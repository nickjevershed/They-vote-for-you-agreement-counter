    "summary": "Anne McEwen\n\nAt the request of Senator Collins, I move:\n\nThat the following matter be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee for inquiry and report by 25 June 2015:\n\nThe handling of a letter sent by Mr Man Haron Monis to the Attorney-General dated 7 October 2014, and the evidence provided during the Budget estimates, including the subsequent correction of that evidence, with particular reference to:\n\n(a) the details of the internal inquiry conducted by the Secretary of the Attorney-General\u2018s Department, Mr Chris Moraitis, following the discovery that incorrect evidence had been provided and any subsequent changes made to administrative practices between the department and the Attorney-General\u2018s office;\n\n(b) the consideration given by the Joint Commonwealth and New South Wales review team to the correspondence sent by Mr Monis to various members of Parliament and other relevant documents and the basis for the assertion by Mr Thawley that the correspondence would make no difference to the findings of the review; and\n\n(c) what, if any, changes were made to procedures for the handling of incoming correspondence to the Attorney-General\u2018s Department and the Attorney-General\u2018s Office following the raising of the national terrorism public alert level to \u2017High\u2018 on 12 September 2014.\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nThe government does not support this motion, because it is inappropriate for the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee to inquire into a matter that has been before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee's examination of estimates, where the legislation committee still, on a spillover day, has the capacity to inquire further and indeed has indicated that it intends to do so. Odgers' _Australian Senate Practice_ states:\n\n\u2022 references committees inquire into matters referred to them by the Senate, other than matters\n\nto be referred to legislation committees\n\n\u2022 legislation committees inquire into bills, estimates, annual reports and performance of agencies\n\nOn that basis, this matter is currently and properly within the jurisdiction of the legislation committee. It should not therefore concurrently be before the references committee. That is at variance with Senate practice.\n\nThe motion also seeks a report within six days. Any referral to the references committee would be an unfortunate precedent and a waste of the time of Senate. _(Time expired)_\n\nIan Macdonald\n\nOn a point of order: Senator Brandis has quoted you the Senate rules and Odgers, and with respect, Mr President, could I suggest that you rule the motion out of order, because it is contrary to the practices of the Senate. To repeat what Senator Brandis has said: where it is properly before the legislation committee, and this one clearly is. It was discussed and, as chairman, I have since had a request from three members of that committee to have a spillover specially on this point, which the committee will deal with at its meeting tomorrow.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nThank you, Senator Macdonald. You are now delving into debating the issue. I do accept that you have raised a point of order in relation to whether or not the Senate can properly deal with this motion. The Senate can. This is the forum, the body, that determines what goes before it and what decisions it makes. Yes, in the past there has been a delineation that has been observed in practice, but the Senate can make that decision, and it is the Senate that will make that decision. So there is no point of order.\n\nIan Macdonald\n\nMr President, I have a further point of order. This is being raised for the first time and you say it is a matter for the Senate to debate and decide. If it is a formal motion, the Senate will not have the opportunity of debating and deciding. If the rules mean anything, we should either abide by the standing orders or get rid of them. Where it clearly says that this should not happen, it is up to you, with respect, Mr President, to rule it out of order and uphold the standing orders.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nAgain on your point of order, Senator Macdonald, the standing orders are not being breached. The standing orders are being complied with. In relation to the Senate not having the opportunity to vote on the motion at the moment, that is correct. But any senator had the opportunity a moment ago to deny formality. This motion has been accepted as a formal motion. I did not hear any senator deny formality. If that had been the case, the motion could have been debated at a later juncture. In that case, I will now put the motion moved by Senator McEwen on behalf of Senator Collins.\n\n",
