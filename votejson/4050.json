    "summary": "Rachel Siewert\n\nby leave\u2014I move Greens amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7817:\n\n(1) Schedule 1, item 14, page 5 (lines 6 to 8), to be opposed.\n\n(2) Schedule 1, item 32, page 8 (lines 4 to 6), to be opposed.\n\n(3) Schedule 1, item 87, page 14 (lines 24 to 27), to be opposed.\n\nI did listen to and note the comments the minister made about the regulation impact statement. Unfortunately, it does not address the issues of our concerns. We believe that this amendment would in fact strengthen the regulatory process and protections. As I said, often it is the best explanation of why changes are being made, so we believe that this amendment would be a stronger approach than the approach that the minister outlined during her contribution. I commend the amendments to the chamber.\n\nFiona Nash\n\nWe as government do not support the amendment. So as not to take up any more time of the Senate chamber, I refer to my earlier statements in my summing up speech. We do believe that this is the most appropriate way forward.\n\nKaty Gallagher\n\nLabor will not be supporting this amendment. We are satisfied that the provisions contained in the government bill provide for a regulatory impact statement to be prepared as appropriate.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that amendments (1) to (3) on sheet 7817 be considered. The question will be that items 14, 32 and 87 of schedule 1 stand as printed.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nby leave\u2014I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7804:\n\n(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 4), omit the table item.\n\n(2) Schedule 2, page 21 (line 1) to page 26 (line 13), to be opposed.\n\nI did cover off these amendments during my earlier speech. They relate to the composition of the FSANZ board and the fact that we are not supporting the changes to the composition of the FSANZ board. This is on the bases that it is currently finely balanced and we are concerned that the proposed amendments by the government give the minister discretion to appoint a bloc of members to the board from a range of criteria. Our concern is that, if the minister were to appoint a bloc of consumer rights members or people with industry background, that balance on the board would be lost. As for whether to admit the National Health and Medical Research Council, it could also diminish expertise in relation to the skills set that they bring to the board. They have contributed excellently to the board over the last 15 years, and we see no reason why they should not be included or maintain their position on the board. We are also concerned in the overall reduction in the number of public health and science based positions on the board. We accept that juggling the appointments to the board is not an easy challenge for the minister; however, we are concerned that, by granting so much flexibility, the board potentially could lose focus or its independence.\n\nIt is the key decision-making body in FSANZ. It is charged with developing and implementing the food code. The opposition's view is that its composition remain unchanged. These amendments seek to do just that.\n\nFiona Nash\n\nI indicate to the chamber that the government does not support these amendments. While I take on board the comments that have been made by both Labor and the Greens on this issue, the government does not agree with the amendments. The intent of this has been to open up the pool of potential candidates, while of course the intention is still to keep the balance in the mix on the board across consumer rights, science, public health and food industry board members.\n\nFirstly, I note in particular that concerns have been raised about the NHMRC not being required under this to have a position on the board. That does not mean NHMRC are precluded from a position on the board. Indeed, it may well be that they will be the appropriate body to have that position. But this is about opening up the pool available for consideration for the board. To be very clear: NHMRC are not precluded and may well be considered. The total number of the board members with consumer rights, science, public health and food industry expertise is no different from the current membership.\n\nI would also like to address the issue of ministerial discretion. I note Senator Siewert's comments earlier about not necessarily the government of the day but perhaps future governments having discretion. As chair of the food forum and knowing that the food forum has the final say over the appointment of the board and how that operates, I think that very much diminishes any possibility of ministerial discretion at any point in time weighting the board members given that that is a decision that goes back to all states, territories and New Zealand for their oversight. We will not be supporting the amendment.\n\nRachel Siewert\n\nI do have to note my frustration that this is the same amendment that the Greens have. We are listed first on the grey, and I was actually on my feet and did not get the call.\n\nThese amendments are exactly the same as the Greens amendments. We have flagged our strong concern about these particular measures by the government. I am sorry; I am not reassured by the minister's comments on the future. I of course take what she has just said in terms of her particular approach, but you still cannot predict what a future forum, people on the forum and future ministers may do.\n\nI think it is a dangerous move to change the make-up of the board. Its independence is particularly important. Having the experts there is particularly important. There is the potential, through this amendment bill, for an industry dominated approach, and we do not support that. As I said, stakeholders have expressed to me repeatedly their concerns about the influence of industry in this process already. This would potentially further entrench industry's influence over decision making, and we think that is a dangerous move, so we do not support the approach the government is taking. Despite the minister's best intent to reassure us, I am not reassured by the minister's comments as they relate to future decisions. These amendments will be in place for a long time, and I do not think that we can adequately ensure that there are the protections there in case of future decision making.\n\nSo we support these amendments to the bill. The Greens have exactly the same amendments, which I flagged during my speech on the second reading. Obviously, once we have dealt with these I will not be moving mine, but we do support these amendments.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: Senator Siewert, in relation to your initial comments, I can just advise you that _Odgers'_ does provide some guidance to the chair in matters like this in terms of the precedence for the call. It can be found on page 241 of _Odgers_', but I can advise you that an opposition senator leading for the opposition in relation to a bill or other matters before the Senate is usually given the call before other senators. I do note that both you and Senator Gallagher rose at the same time, and I applied _Odgers__'_ practice. I just hope that explains the decision I made.\n\nFiona Nash\n\nI will just briefly respond to the senator. I appreciate the senator's comment around how my approach would be in the current circumstances. However I just need to correct the record. It is not my approach; it is the legislation that requires it. New Zealand, as a member of the food forum, must be consulted, and the legislation requires that the food forum's non-New Zealand members\u2014the jurisdictions of Australia\u2014agree to the appointments. I think anybody that has had any involvement with that food forum would know that things are very robustly discussed. Reaching consensus on issues always is as a result of, as I say, very robust discussion and consideration. I am very confident that, even in a future iteration of government, that process would provide the surety to ensure that ministerial discretion did not allow a weighting of board appointments.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that schedule 2 as amended be agreed to.\n\n",
