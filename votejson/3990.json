    "summary": "Kim Carr\n\nI would like to indicate to the committee that it is my intention to seek leave to move six separate blocks of amendments relating to the nature of visas, increased penalties, business numbers, whistleblower protections, reporting obligations, coercion and criminal offences and civil penalties in relation to visa holders. So I indicate that these are separate measures and I believe that we can vote on these as blocks.

or\n\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(ii) the migration outcome-related provision or provisions; or\n\nAs I noted during the second reading debate, in our judgement this bill is defective in that the bill does not apply to all work related visas, including student visas and working holiday visas. It is limited to employer sponsored visas, but the kinds of exploitation that the bill seeks to prevent have arisen with regard to other visas as well. As we have seen with the 7-Eleven examples, these amendments extend protection to all holders of temporary work visas and subject their employers to the same penalty regime. A consequential amendment substitutes the term 'migration outcome related event' for the term used in the bill: 'sponsorship event'. The thrust of these matters is to provide proper protections, not taking away rights but actually enhancing the rights of visa holders when, as we have seen, there have been so many examples of people being ripped off.\n\nNigel Scullion\n\nWe will not be supporting these amendments. Whilst the principles of the mischief that you wish to ameliorate are sound, this is specifically about particular coercion for a particular group. Government would say that it is not appropriate within this legislation to spread the mischief from actually coercive behaviour, in the purchasing or receiving of benefits from either the party of the person who receives the visa or in fact the sponsor who is assisting in providing the visa, to some issues around how much you actually get paid. They are significantly separate issues, and we would say that the matter that you are referring to should be dealt with by Fair Work Australia.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
