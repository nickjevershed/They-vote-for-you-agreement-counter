We have a multifaceted approach to combating corruption. We are always looking at how we can strengthen that, rather than throwing the whole system out based on the presumption that a national anticorruption commission will be more effective. The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is responsible for preventing, detecting and investigating serious issues of corruption in federal law enforcement agencies. Furthermore, the Commonwealth Ombudsman performs an important function in investigating and auditing various agencies and functions. The Australian Federal Police also play a fundamental role in investigating serious corruption issues. The government will continue to take a strong approach to tackling corruption in all forms.\n\nRachel Siewert\n\nI seek leave to amend the motion.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nSenator Siewert, just to assist the chamber, you may wish to flag the nature of your amendment.\n\nRachel Siewert\n\nMy amendment is to change the number of senators that will make up the committee to seven, to include a Greens member.\n\nLeave not granted.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nThe suggestion from the government is that, if there is consent to postpone the motion, we could deal with it tomorrow. But it is up to the mover of the motion\u2014if the mover wants to postpone the motion till tomorrow, if the amendment curries favour with the mover.\n\nDio Wang\n\nI wish to move the motion today, Mr President.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nThe question is that the motion moved by Senator Wang be agreed to.\n\n",
