    "summary": "David Johnston\n\nI table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI will put a couple of general questions relating to the purposes of the bill. I would also like to acknowledge the amendments that Senator Johnston has just tabled. They actually go quite a long way, a remarkable way, towards quieting some of the concerns that have been expressed by those in the sector, by transport academics and by people who watch this area. So I would like to acknowledge quite genuinely that it is rare in this place to see errors as grievous as those contained in the bill not have to be shot out on the floor of the chamber but in fact moved by the government. It saves the opposition and the cross benches a great deal of time when a government of either political persuasion brings these amendments forward themselves.\n\nSenator Johnston, I have a couple of general questions before we get into the substance and detail of the amendments that the Greens, the opposition and the government are proposing to move. Can you explain for us in simple terms why the Australian government has cancelled all funding for public transport and on what policy basis the Australian government has decided to get out of the business of funding urban rail infrastructure?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI think that question is a bit of a distraction and away from the bill, but the point is that the government has chosen where it seeks to augment and facilitate productivity and to enhance the Australian economy. We have acknowledged that road funding, which is an integral part of public transport, is a very important part of infrastructure that has been neglected.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI am also acknowledging, Senator Johnston, that this is not your portfolio. You are here in a representative capacity and you just have to make do with the best that your advisers can throw at you this evening. I found the answer profoundly unsatisfying. Are you aware of the productivity and economic benefits, agglomeration benefits and various other benefits in terms of quality of life and even just straightforward economic advantages of the Commonwealth funding public transport infrastructure? It is not only roads that have these benefits.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nIf we are going to be here talking about quality of life issues, I am sure that we are going to be here for the rest of the week. Can we get on with the amendments, please?\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nNo, with great respect, I turned up tonight to do my job, not to make your life easy. Apologies if those two things sometimes come into conflict. Irrespective of expert advice, irrespective of the board of Infrastructure Australia and irrespective of Michael Deegan, the Infrastructure Coordinator, the government decided\u2014or I should say, really, that the Prime Minister decided from opposition; he telegraphed it, no-one can say that they were surprised or they did not see it coming\u2014that it objects to Commonwealth funding for public transport. The Prime Minister said, 'We should just look after our own knitting,' or some utterly bizarre words to that effect.\n\nI do not understand why you would do that and it is directly relevant to this bill. The opposition has proposed sensible amendments that restore the independence of Infrastructure Australia, which you are proposing to take away. Why have you pre-emptively decided not to provide Commonwealth funding for an entire class of infrastructure?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nSince you have drawn me into this discussion, let me tell you that, as you know, there was a Senate inquiry into this matter. The department, of course, gave testimony to that inquiry. It set out that it did not agree that the bill would limit the type of project to be evaluated by Infrastructure Australia and, in particular, its ability to assess public transport projects. The Australian Automobile Association also noted that it is neither the intent nor the practical impact of the bill to exclude proposals for investment in public transport. Gee, there is a revelation, Senator!\n\nFurthermore, the department noted that the act currently provides for Infrastructure Australia to evaluate proposals for investment in nationally significant infrastructure only by ministerial request. In contrast, the bill would enable this function to be performed without a ministerial request, except in relation to proposals in the class determined by the minister under 5A(1)(a) and (2).\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI do not intend to tie us up on this matter all night, because the minister is clearly not enjoying himself very much. Could you just clarify for us: in terms of the law, as it appears that the bill will be amended by the opposition and by ourselves, it is entirely open to the board of IA to accept public transport proposals from the states and territories, to evaluate them and to provide that advice. Is it still possible under the government's new drafted amendments?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI am advised that you are correct, that is still possible.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nThe board of IA is free to do that. It is free to apply the best methodological tools of analysis that they can, except that you have already decided that you will not be funding them under any circumstances. Is that correct?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nThat is not correct.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nIs it current Commonwealth government policy not to fund urban rail infrastructure?\n\nStephen Conroy\n\nIt is just a coincidence they get nothing. You Greens are always into conspiracy theories.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI do not think it is a coincidence, I think this is policy. This is one of the few election commitments that the Prime Minister made that he has decided to uphold. Is it the case that the Australian government will not be funding urban rail infrastructure? That is a yes or no question.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nWhat the government has done by saying that it will fund certain projects is to free up the states so that they can fund the projects of their choice. The rail projects that you are talking about are the sort of projects that the states are now more able to deal with themselves.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nSenator Johnston, you are from Western Australia. You come from the same town as me. Are you aware that the Barnett government cancelled the Perth light rail project on the basis of the half a billion dollars' worth of funding that you took off the table?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nNo, I am not.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nFor the record, can you just state this very clearly for us: you are not aware that that funding was cancelled on the basis of the Commonwealth taking that money off the table?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nNo, I am not.\n\nSenator Conroy interjecting\u2014\n\nSue Boyce\n\nSenator Conroy, when you have the call, please use it.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI am finding the interjections extremely helpful. I think the position here is fairly clear. I am sorry, Minister, that you have been lumbered with this dog and I recognise that this is not your portfolio. It is a shame\u2014on behalf of everybody who believed the Barnett government when they said they were going to bring that project forward\u2014that you ripped half a billion dollars out of it and the project collapsed.\n\nThat is why I am putting to you, in fact, that when you take that money off the table it does not free the states up to do other things at all. It means that these projects collapse. The Brisbane cross-city rail project has collapsed. Work on the Metro Rail project in Melbourne\u2014and Senator Conroy will correct me if I am wrong\u2014is dead in the water. Any extensions to Sydney's urban heavy-rail system is stuffed. In fact, what you have just told the Senate, which was that it would free up the states and territories to do that work, is actually directly the opposite of what is occurring. Will you undertake to advocate in your party room for a change of policy so that we can get these public transport projects back on the rails?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI know you have got an axe to grind on certain urban public transport projects, but the Western Australian government, the Victorian government and the New South Wales government have made very substantial contributions and provisions in their budgets\u2014all recently announced\u2014for such programs. This is in line with what I said to you about freeing up the funding for the states to have some flexibility to fund programs of their choice.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nCan you name one urban rail project that is now going ahead in the absence of that Commonwealth funding, which I have just gone through in some detail? Just one?\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI am told that in Brisbane there is an underground rail and bus infrastructure program underway.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nThey just got through the gate before you cancelled their funding. I might come back to that a bit later. I am not familiar with that project. I will come back to some general questions a bit later in the debate, but let's just get started on the running sheet. I bring forward the first Australian Greens amendment on the running sheet, which is schedule 1, item 8. I will put to the chamber what this amendment does, effectively, and seek opposition and government support. The current bill requires Infrastructure Australia to take into account forecast growth when it is conducting its audits to determine the adequacy, capacity and condition of nationally significant infrastructure. That is reasonable. The Greens simply seek to add 'consideration of economic, social, environmental sustainability' when Infrastructure Australia performs these audits. Infrastructure Australia is a small team. It is not a vast government department. It is a relatively small, very expertise based group of people. So, effectively, what they are doing is outsourcing to the states and territories the primary work. When projects are brought forward for consideration by IA, that work is being done in state planning and transport departments, energy departments or departments of water for that matter, depending on the project kind.\n\nUnless we embed these considerations in the process of conducting these audits to get a sense of where the major infrastructure gaps are, which is one of the most valuable functions that IA performs, unless we take into account the so-called triple bottom line of economic, social and environmental sustainability\u2014conducted at the same time for the same piece of infrastructure and not done in separate silos\u2014we are going to end up building the wrong stuff. In some parts of the country there has been a pretty sad history of doing exactly that.\n\nI commend the first Greens amendment on the running sheet that adds a second clause 'economic, social and environmental sustainability' when IA is conducting those audits. I commend that amendment to the chamber.\n\nThe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: I do not like to be terribly churlish here, but are you moving the amendments, Senator Ludlam?\n\nThank you for pulling me up on that, Chair. I seek some guidance and some commentary from the government and the opposition as to whether they will support this most worthwhile amendment.\n\nStephen Conroy\n\nCould I concur. It is a most worthwhile amendment, Senator Ludlam, and we will be supporting it.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nThe government is opposed to the amendments, because these considerations will be undertaken and will form part of the assessment, the cost-benefit analysis, by Infrastructure Australia. We see that they are not necessary and further legally complicate the legislation. They are logically and naturally part of the assessment. Why would we need to put them in the bill?\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nMinister, you might forgive the Greens for not taking you at your word when you say, 'Why would you omit economic, social and environmental sustainability when making infrastructure decisions?' You might not be too surprised that I do not take this government at its word that you would just automatically consider those things. The Prime Minister thinks climate change is absolute crap, and I will have a little bit more to say about that when we get to those specific clauses later in the evening. You do not have a very good record on this stuff\u2014not you personally, Minister; but the government absolutely does not have a good record. In that case, I look forward to committing this amendment to the chamber. I move the amendment on sheet 7482 revised:\n\n(1) Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (lines 22 to 24), omit paragraph 5(a), substitute:\n\n(a) to conduct audits to determine the adequacy, capacity and condition of nationally significant infrastructure, taking into account:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(i) forecast growth; and\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(ii) economic, social and environmental sustainability;\n\nI look forward to it passing to the House of Representatives, where the minister will be given a chance to have some second thoughts and hopefully come up with a better line of argument than you have, Senator Johnston, with great respect.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI appreciate this, but we have said that this bill is about independence. We are not going to prescribe to Infrastructure Australia the way in which they should go about doing their cost-benefit analysis. This is what the whole of this legislation is about\u2014an independent, arm's length from government assessment.\n\nThe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: The question is that Australian Greens amendment to schedule 1, item 8, be agreed to:\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nThe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: We will now move to the next Greens amendment.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
