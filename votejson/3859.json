It receives regular media coverage and commensurate outrage from community and large animal welfare networks. The recent inquiry into National Senator Back's Ag-gag private members bill received over 2,000 responses.\n\nIn the face of continuing animal abuse, this government has responded by dissolving the federal Australian Animal Welfare Strategy and its independent advisory committee, and the Inspector General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports.\n\nIn 2012 Labor endorsed the developing of a model for an Office of Animal Welfare, which was then set aside when Labor gained government. Last week Labor tabled a motion in the House noting the Government's abolition of Inspector General of Animal Welfare and Live Animal Exports. This inquiry can provide an opportunity to test Labor's commitment.\n\nThe inquiry will also provide an important animal welfare campaign hook, especially if an early election is called.\n\nPossible submissions or evidence from:\n\nAnimals Australia, RSPCA Australia, Animal Liberation Australia, Barristers Animal Welfare Panel, Sentient, Vets against Live Export, PETA Asia Pacific, Humane Society International, Humane Research Australia, Australia Veterinary Association, Voiceless, Lawyers for Animals, World Animal Protection, Animal Justice Party, Choose Cruelty Free.\n\nCommittee to which bill is to be referred:\n\nRural and Regional Affairs and Transport\n\nPossible hearing date(s):\n\nWeeks of beginning 21 & 28 August\n\nPossible reporting date:\n\nSeptember sittings\n\n(signed)\n\nSenator Rachel Siewert\n\nI move:\n\nThat the report from the committee be adopted.\n\nClaire Moore\n\nMr Deputy President, I have an amendment. We have circulated the amendment to the Selection of Bills Committee report, and I believe the Greens also have an amendment to the Selection of Bills Committee report. Ours, as circulated, refers to the Shipping Legislation Amendment Bill 2015. I move:\n\nThat the provisions of that bill be referred immediately to the Rural, Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by the first sitting day of 2016.\n\nGavin Marshall\n\nBear with me a moment, Senator Fifield. Senator Siewert, my advice is that your amendment is actually in the form of an amendment to Senator Moore's amendment. So I might call on you now\u2014and I will see how I deal with your amendment to those two amendments. We will see how we go.\n\nRachel Siewert\n\nI do understand now. Senator Moore moved her amendment first, and I am now amending hers. I do apologise. I move:\n\nAt the end of the amendment, add, \"and:\n\n(1) the Migration Amendment (Regional Processing Arrangements) Bill 2015, the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 18 August 2015; and\n\n(2) the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Allegiance to Australia) Bill 2015, the provisions of the bill be referred to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee for inquiry and report by 19 August 2015.\".\n\nGavin Marshall\n\nSenator Fifield, I understand that you have foreshadowed a further amendment. What I intend to deal with first is Senator Siewert's amendment to Senator Moore's amendment, and then I will come back to you for a further amendment to the amendment. The question before the chair now is that Senator Siewert's amendment be agreed to.\n\n",
