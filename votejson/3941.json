    "summary": "Doug Cameron\n\nI would like to move amendments on sheet 7771 as a whole.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: There are a number of amendments in different parts of the running sheet on sheet 7771. We have not dealt with amendments (4) and (5), which we probably need to deal with separately.\n\nby leave\u2014I move amendments (4) and (5) on sheet 771 together.\n\n(4) Schedule 1, item 28, page 13 (lines 11 to 32), to be opposed.\n\n(5) Schedule 1, items 30 to 39, page 14 (line 1) to page 15 (line 18), to be opposed.\n\nIn relation to these amendments, I just want to go to the overall position again. What the government is seeking to do is ensure that there are realistic time frames for the negotiation of greenfield agreements. They are seeking to ensure that negotiations do not delay or jeopardise investment in major projects, and they are seeking to provide for the interests of employees to be covered by such agreement that they are protected. So I again want to say that I do not think the bill achieves these objectives; and our amendments, the Labor Party amendments, would achieve these objectives in what I believe is a more fair and equitable manner.\n\nIn relation to greenfield agreements, the panel made four recommendations. The first recommendation, No. 27, was that good faith bargaining requirements apply to the negotiations of greenfield agreements. The second recommendation, No. 28, was that employers intending to negotiate a greenfield agreement take all reasonable steps to notify all unions with eligibility to represent relevant employees. And the third recommendation, No. 29, was that section 240 of the act should be available to be utilised to resolve disputes over greenfield agreement negotiations. The fourth recommendation was that, when an impasse in negotiations is reached, when a specified time period has elapsed and when conciliation by the commission has failed, the commission may conduct last offer arbitration upon application by a party on its own motion.\n\nThose were the overall recommendations that were put by the expert panel. Labor, in our amendments, go closer to dealing with these issues than the coalition's amendments do. The fourth recommendation was for a last offer arbitration model. That is a different model than has been agreed in this country. We have never used a last offer arbitration model, but we believe there is a role for arbitration in relation to these greenfield agreements because it would provide more certainty to investors, more certainty to employers and more certainty to unions who are in that bargaining process. And I think it would give more incentive to actually bargain with good faith than the proposals that have been put forward by the opposition.\n\nThe opposition proposals would mean that there can be a fig leaf of bargaining in good faith. Then, at the end of that period or close to the end of that period, the employers do not need to do anything\u2014they do not need to bargain\u2014and they can take what they want the commission to deal with. They take it to the commission. So there is a far better proposition being put by Labor on this issue.\n\nI want to go back to the explanatory memorandum on the government's bill. In the explanatory memorandum it talks a lot about certainty of wage costs; it talks about the costs of bargaining over a period of time, without coming to some conclusion. I will put this to the minister again, because she did not answer it last time. Is the minister aware of any greenfield agreements that have not been implemented because of delays by the unions?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nI refer to the regulatory impact statement\n\nIn the regulatory impact statement, the department made a reasonable estimate, based on evidence provided by several stakeholders during the 2012 Fair Work Act review, that greenfields negotiations are lengthy and onerous. And I can refer you to page 169 of the Fair Work Act review. The regulatory impact statement itself says bringing in a three-month period\u2014albeit I acknowledge we have extended that with the agreement of the crossbenchers to a six-month period\u2014will save $64 million a year in costs and administration and the Office of Best Practice Regulation approved the methodology.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nAgain, I come back to the question that I asked: are you aware of any greenfield agreement that has not been implemented because of excessive delays by the unions?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nAgain, the panel review identified there was a problem. They have identified recommendations. We have looked at the recommendations and we are proposing a solution. You do not agree with our solution. And, as I have said to you, it is a quarter to nine and there is a very good chance we will be here at 10 to 10, but I do not think I can assist you any further. We are not supporting your amendments\u2014that is it.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nThat is a bit arrogant when I am asking you a simple question. You can filibuster all you like in your response, but if you do not know the answer just tell me you do not know the answer, but\u2014\n\nSean Edwards\n\nSenator Cameron, if you want to verbal the minister choose another way. The minister has given you an answer. If you do not like the answer, rephrase your question.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nWith respect, Chair, the minister has not given me an answer. The question is simple and I will ask it again: Minister, do you or the department know of any greenfield agreement\u2014you have got the whole department sitting there beside you\u2014that has been delayed because of unions' intransigence?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nSenator Cameron, again, you can be as cute as you want in asking the question to try to make the political point that I do not agree with. But if I could refer you to page 169 of your very own report of the panel that was appointed by the now Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten. At paragraph 3, it states:\n\nMany employers argued that the provisions enabling greenfields agreements under the FW Act are not working efficiently. The MBA, for example, submits that unions are using their position of power to seek leverage on matters not related to development of the agreement, and that start-up agreements on major projects are non-existent without union consent. VECCI submits that unions \u2018hijack\u2019 the agreement making process. The Minerals Council of Australia submits that negotiations with unions are lengthy, tortuous and onerous. Business SA submits that unions make inflated claims in greenfields negotiations. The Institute of Public Affairs submits that requiring negotiations with unions is inconsistent with other agreements under the FW Act, and jeopardises projects.\n\nThere is the evidence, at page 169, of your own review.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nThat is not evidence. They are assertions from employer organisations. I would like you to answer: are you aware or are any of the departmental officers aware, of any instance where a greenfield agreement has been held up by the intransigence of the unions in the bargaining process? It might be tough. It might be extended negotiations. Give us the evidence. Tell us the evidence, so we can make a judgement in relation to the issues that you want passed here. If there has been none, why don't you just be honest about it and say there has been none?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nSenator Cameron, you yourself have moved amendments to this particular part of the bill, which would indicate that you yourself believe that there is an issue that needs to be rectified. Again, I refer you to the evidence at page 169 of your own review.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nAt the moment, we are dealing specifically with item (4) and item (5). At item (4), we are opposing the government amendments, which in effect create an employer greenfields agreement at the conclusion of the notified negotiating period. I have heard the arguments that this is not an employer agreement. But the reality is that on issues where there is no agreement, and it could be on issues that have never been negotiated, we could end up with a document\u2014not an agreement but a document\u2014going to the Fair Work Commission and that document ending up being the basis of the terms and conditions at the workplace.\n\nWe are also opposing, in item (5), the government amendments which are consequential in opposing the amendments which create an employer greenfields agreement. So what the crossbench need to understand now is that this is crunch time in terms of these employer agreements. I am not convinced, and Labor is not convinced, from the arguments that we have heard from the minister that this does not give an unfair advantage to the employer. The employer is already in a very powerful position; an extremely powerful position. The employer will be given further industrial relations weapons against unions trying to negotiate a fair and reasonable outcome. They only have to wait out the time period and then get the agreement to the commission. The commission, provided it deals with some of the basic issues, will tick off on this agreement. That is basically a denial of longstanding industrial rights in this country. It is a breach, in my view, of international conventions that we have signed off on. It is not allowing negotiations to take place free of government interference.\n\nOnce you start agreeing on these issues now, there will be big problems down the track with this government. We know that they want to give more strength and more power to the employer at the expense of employees. This is not, as the minister argues, some extra protection for workers. It is basically forcing an employer agreement down the throat of the unions who represent the workers who will be engaged in that job. That is the bottom line. This is not about a proper arbitration where people can argue their points; this is simply about the imposition of an employer set of clauses against the unions who represent the workers who will be engaged on that project. That is why in four and five we are opposing the government's amendments.\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nYou are relitigating\u2014and it is your right to relitigate\u2014a number of the issues that you and I have already canvassed in previous amendments on this bill, but for the purposes of the record I will again state that your assertions that the changes put forward by the government will allow an employer to make an agreement without union involvement are incorrect. By virtue of what a greenfields agreement is it is not allowed to be done.\n\nA greenfields agreement is an agreement, with no employees but a prospective workforce, between an employer and a union or unions. With all due respect, you can say it as many times as you like tonight in an effort to try to put some merit into the amendments that you have only put forward at the very last minute today. I note that the amendments that we are currently looking at you had not proposed three weeks ago when we had an extensive second reading debate on this issue. I only received them late this morning.\n\nYou continue to say that our amendments will allow an employer-only agreement. That is incorrect. It is wrong. The bill requires an employer to negotiate in good faith with the union or unions that are able to represent the industrial interests of the employees who are going to be covered by the agreement. The Fair Work Commission itself must note in its decision to approve the agreement that the agreement covers the union or unions that were bargaining representatives for the agreement. The changes that we are referring to maintain a role for unions in negotiating greenfields agreements.\n\nYou also have made assertions\u2014again, that you have previously made this evening\u2014in relation to the greenfields agreement making process that we are putting forward heavily favouring employers, and again we reject that assertion in its entirety. I again go to the words of the fair work review panel, which I remind the chamber is the review panel which the now Leader of the Opposition, Bill Shorten, himself appointed. They themselves say:\n\n\u2026 a significant capacity to frustrate the making of an appropriate greenfields agreement at all or at least in a timely way.\n\nThat is what the current framework has, effectively, conferred on the unions such that the current negotiations for greenfield agreements potentially threaten future investment in major projects in Australia.\n\nAgain, in terms of what we are proposing tonight, the existing agreement approval rules under the Fair Work Act are retained. The bill also\u2014again, as I have already stated several times tonight in response to the same questions from you\u2014says that, where agreement cannot be reached with the union, the union will be covered by any greenfields agreement approved by the Fair Work Commission to ensure that they can enforce that agreement on behalf of future employees. To the Fair Work Commission\u2014and this is the fundamental difference between what is currently in the act and what we are bringing in\u2014in addition to passing the better-off-overall test, or the BOOT, as it is known, we have added the additional layer that the agreement provides for pay and conditions that are consistent with the prevailing pay and conditions within the relevant industry for equivalent work.\n\nI reject the assertions that you yet again make.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nWhat is there to prevent an employer from negotiating a greenfield agreement for 170 days or whatever the time frame is and then presenting an entirely different agreement to the Fair Work Commission as long as they have shown it to the union?\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
