    "summary": "Glenn Lazarus\n\nThe Palmer United Party oppose schedule 7 in the following terms:\n\n(1) Schedule 7, page 37 (line 1) to page 39 (line 3), to be opposed.\n\nWe oppose this schedule of the Minerals Resource Rent Tax Repeal and Other Measures Bill 2013 [No.2], commonly known as the mining tax repeal bill, to ensure the low-income superannuation contribution is continued.\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nAs we made very clear in the lead-up to the last election, we were committed to getting rid of the mining tax and we also said that, given this is failed tax which does not raise any revenue, we were also going to get rid of all the unfunded spending promises attached to it. This proposal before the chamber has a cost of $3.6 billion over the forward estimates, which is of course $3.6 billion the budget does not have. That is why the government is opposed to this proposition.\n\nChristine Milne\n\nThe Australian Greens have an amendment which is identical to what has just been proposed, the aim of which is to retain the low-income superannuation contribution. The low-income superannuation contribution is about reducing inequality in Australia and that is something the Australian Greens are passionate about. One of the worst things happening in this country is the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. Taking away the low-income superannuation contribution at the same time as allowing the wealthiest people in the country to maximise their wealth through superannuation is quite wrong. At the same time as the Prime Minister is supposedly standing up for women in Australia, here he is taking away the low-income superannuation contribution, which is a real attack on women\u2014because we know that women are the ones who are likely to have lower incomes and who are more likely to be left without adequate superannuation. That is why we so strongly support this proposal.\n\nAs for the government going on about removing the mining tax and therefore having to remove the unfunded other programs associated with it\u2014how about a bit of consistency? The government has today removed the carbon price but kept all the carbon price compensation. At the same time it is hitting the community with co-payments. It is taking with the one hand and giving with the other. So it is a bit rich to hear a minister talk about 'unfunded' parts of something while they are abolishing the mining tax. They are busily rearranging the deck chairs on the _Titanic_and that is precisely where the government's budget is. It is the _Titanic_ and it has hit the iceberg of the Australian community. That is exactly how Australians feel about this government\u2014and they are not likely to warm to it.\n\nClaire Moore\n\nThe low-income superannuation contribution was an important initiative of the last Labor government. We are committed to superannuation. We are particularly committed to effectively providing superannuation options for the most vulnerable, low-paid workers in our community. The low-income superannuation contribution was focused specifically on low-paid workers. It was to ensure that their superannuation would be maximised. If we lose this, we will be increasing superannuation taxes on one in three of Australia's lowest paid workers.\n\nThere has been great support\u2014identical motions\u2014from a range of parties in this place. It shows that they have been listening to the community. There has been an extremely strong community response to this particular element of the process. We have had email campaigns and people coming to see us. They care about this particular payment. They care about their superannuation.\n\nThis will be one step towards making superannuation more equal in our community. As Senator Milne has said, there would be a particular impact on women. We know from the statistics\u2014that is clear. There is no lack of clarity around the importance of this particular process. This encourages people to look after their superannuation process. It links them into their superannuation. One of the elements has always been having people own their own financial integrity through their superannuation. This is an important element.\n\nIn the last parliament this was one of the major things we were able to do as a government. We are committed to this process. We strongly support the amendments before us\u2014by so many people. We are sharing this amendment. We call upon the government to support this amendment, it is so important. Please vote for this amendment.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that schedule 7 stand as printed.\n\n",
