    "summary": "Stephen Parry\n\nI remind senators that the question may be put on any proposal at the request of any senator.\n\nIan Macdonald\n\nI am not quite sure what the rules are, but I certainly object to this proposal. I am the proponent of the other proposal, notwithstanding that I have an aversion to committees meeting when the Senate is sitting.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nSenator Macdonald, I take it you wish you to have the question put on this proposal?\n\nIan Macdonald\n\nYes.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nIt is your right to do so. I will put the question. The question is:\n\nThat the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Queensland Government Administration related to Commonwealth Government Affairs be authorised to meet during the sitting of the Senate today.\n\nIan Macdonald\n\nMr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nIan Macdonald\n\nThis is a stupid situation with respect to those of us who approved it. I wanted to try and convince the crossbenchers of the stupidity of this hearing this evening. We have already had, I think, five separate agendas for this hearing. We get a new agenda every couple of hours. The committee simply is dysfunctional. We really do not know what we are even discussing tonight. I suggest that by the time the meeting comes around we will have another three different agendas.\n\nIt relates to a meeting that was supposed to be held on Friday. It does not matter what happens tonight. We will not be able to get witnesses in in one day. We will not be able to get a venue. None of this would have been done by the secretariat because to do so would disclose private business of a committee. So we are going to be starting from five o'clock tonight to try and\u2014 _(Time expired)_\n\nStephen Conroy\n\nMr President, I seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nStephen Conroy\n\nSenator Macdonald is now wasting the time of the Senate chamber in the same way that he has been bullying and intimidating witnesses at the actual hearings. He is an absolute pursuit to do nothing other than disrupt\u2014\n\nStephen Parry\n\nPause the clock.\n\nMitch Fifield\n\nMr President, I have a point of order. Senator Conroy has reflected on a colleague in this place. To accuse a colleague of that sort of behaviour is contrary to standing orders, and Senator Conroy should withdraw.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nSenator Conroy, in relation to the comments you made about Senator Macdonald, I think it would be advisable, if you are kind enough, to withdraw. Then you will have 43 seconds to continue your remarks.\n\nStephen Conroy\n\nI accept your ruling and I withdraw, Mr President.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nThank you, Senator Conroy.\n\nStephen Conroy\n\nBut let's be very clear about what is going on at this committee. There is bullying and intimidation going on at this committee. That is unacceptable behaviour. It is completely unacceptable behaviour. There is consistent, deliberate time-wasting and there is filibustering, and that is all that we are seeing here today. The Senate has already accepted this committee will take place, and those opposite should just suck it up and get on with asking questions of witnesses.\n\nChristine Milne\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nChristine Milne\n\nMy concern is the proper operation of the Senate. We have a normal process in here that committees often seek leave to meet during the time that the Senate is sitting. If the Senate has agreed that we set up a committee and that process goes ahead then this is normal procedure. If we get to the point where we try and stymie the operations or facilitate the operations of a committee to meet when others do not want to or do not want to meet when the committee decides to, we are going to throw the whole Senate committee system into chaos.\n\nI just do not think we should be able to jeopardise the proper operation of the committee system because people are running whatever agenda they are running, and that is why I think that if the chair wants to have the committee sit, for any committee, then that is a matter for the Senate.\n\nBarry O'Sullivan\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement in relation to this matter.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nBarry O'Sullivan\n\nI am pleased they raised the issue of feeling intimidated, because during the course of some of these meetings I have felt intimidated.\n\nOpposition senators interjecting\u2014\n\nStephen Parry\n\nOrder on my left.\n\nBarry O'Sullivan\n\nI have been bullied.\n\nOpposition senators interjecting\u2014\n\nStephen Parry\n\nOrder on my left.\n\nBarry O'Sullivan\n\nIt is a workplace; you have to remember that. I have been bullied. The point is that it is so dysfunctional that it is necessary to take up the valuable time of senators who ought to be in this chamber this afternoon at the time this meeting is convened . It is so dysfunctional that some of these meetings have gone for 45 minutes and have not made their way to the apologies on the agenda. So to take up valuable time of the senators who are required to go to this meeting this afternoon when we ought to be in this place dealing with important business on behalf of the nation is, again, a support of their sham that this committee has been from the very beginning. This should be rejected.\n\nMitch Fifield\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nLeave is not granted. The question before the chair is that the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Queensland Government Administration be authorised to meet during the sitting of the Senate today.\n\n",
