Proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys, or imposing taxation, shall not originate in the Senate. But a proposed law shall not be taken to appropriate revenue or moneys, or to impose taxation, by reason only of its containing provisions for the imposition or appropriation of fines or other pecuniary penalties, or for the demand or payment or appropriation of fees for licences, or fees for services under the proposed law.\n\nThe Senate may not amend proposed laws imposing taxation, or proposed laws appropriating revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government.\n\nThe Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people.\n\nThe Senate may at any stage return to the House of Representatives any proposed law which the Senate may not amend, requesting, by message, the omission or amendment of any items or provisions therein. And the House of Representatives may, if it thinks fit, make any of such omissions or amendments, with or without modifications.\n\nExcept as provided in this section, the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all proposed laws.\n\nAmendment (14)\n\nThe effect of this amendment is to expand the purposes for which payments may be made out of the standing appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in clause 99 of the Bill. It is covered by section 53 because expanding the purposes for which payments may be made out of the standing appropriation may increase the amount of expenditure out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund under that standing appropriation.\n\nConsequential amendments\n\nAmendments (12) and (13) are consequential on the amendment mentioned above.\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nBusiness Services Wage Assessment Tool Payment Scheme Bill 2014\n\nSHEET EH217\n\nStatement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000\n\nAmendment (14)\n\nThe stated effect of paragraph 99(c) contained in this amendment is to provide for payments to be made, for actions or activities specified in new clause 98A, from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The increased expenditure would be met directly from the standing appropriation contained in clause 99 of the bill.\n\nThe Senate has long followed the practice that it should treat as requests amendments which would clearly, necessarily and directly result in increased expenditure under a standing appropriation. If, as stated, this amendment would result in increased expenditure under the standing appropriation in clause 99 of the bill, it is in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that this amendment be moved as a request.\n\nAmendments (12) and (13)\n\nAmendments (12) and (13) are consequential on the request. It is the practice of the Senate that amendments purely consequential on amendments framed as requests may also be framed as requests.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
