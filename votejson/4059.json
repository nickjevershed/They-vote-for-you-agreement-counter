There is also no clarity on how projects would be defined as an environmental activity and on what basis a decision is made as to whether a project adheres to that classification.\n\nPossible submissions or evidence from:\n\nStakeholders (e.g. Australian Conservation Foundation)\n\nRelevant government departments (e.g. Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder) Researchers\n\nCommittee to which bill is to be referred:\n\nRural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee\n\nPossible hearing date(s):\n\n15 February 2016\n\n17 February 2016\n\nPossible reporting date:\n\n10 March 2016\n\n(signed)\n\nSenator Siewert\n\nI move:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0That the report be adopted.\n\nClaire Moore\n\nI move and amendment:\n\nAt the end of the motion, add \"but, in respect of the Building and Construction Industry (Improving Productivity) Bill 2013 [No. 2] and the Building and Construction Industry (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2013 [No. 2] the Education and Employment Legislation Committee report by 15 March 2016.\".\n\nThe reason we have asked for this date is to allow fulsome debate in our process. We all know the sensitivities of this legislation; we all know the issues around the legislation and the importance of having engagement on the evidence in front of us. Since we these bills were originally put to the Senate, we have had the TURC report and there is a great need to examine the evidence that came through in that inquiry. We all know there are elements of that which have not been opened to the wider public, so if we are moving to such significant legislation\u2014and these bills are significant legislation\u2014then there should be absolute scrutiny from the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee of the evidence in front of us before we actually come to taking a vote on such important elements.\n\nAs I have said in these discussions many times, that is the role of the Senate. The role of the Senate is to scrutinise legislation. That role does not belong to anybody else. It does not belong exclusively to the royal commission, it does not belong to the media; it belongs to the Senate, and the process for Senate scrutiny is the Senate Education and Employment Legislation Committee. We have an extraordinarily busy couple of weeks in front of us. If you check the calendar, we have Senate estimates, we have two intensive periods of sitting. Arranging for effective scrutiny will take time, and we submit that a report by 15 March gives time to have that scrutiny and also bring back that report for effective debate in the Senate.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
