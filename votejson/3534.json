    "summary": "Gavin Marshall\n\nThe next two items on the running sheet\u2014one by Senators Madigan, Rhiannon and Xenophon and the other one by the opposition\u2014effectively deal in part with the same item that we have just voted on. They also deal with schedule 2. I intend to separate the questions. The first question I will put before the committee\u2014and people can talk about this, but I am letting the chamber know how I intend to proceed\u2014is that schedule 1, as amended, be agreed to. Then I will separately put that schedule 2 stand as printed. That is how I intend to proceed.\n\nLee Rhiannon\n\nI, and also on behalf of Senator Nick Xenophon and Senator John Madigan, oppose schedules 1 and 2 in the following terms:\n\n(3) Schedule 1, page 3 (lines 1 to 5), to be opposed.\n\n(4) Schedule 2, page 4 (lines 1 to 16), to be opposed.\n\nI have been working with Senator Madigan on this aspect of the committee proceedings. We do have concerns with these schedules. We are endeavouring to keep the current foreign ownership requirements contained in the Qantas Sale Act. We need to strengthen the requirements in the Qantas Sale Act in respect of Qantas facilities being located in Australia. I think that is where we, hopefully, have agreement. We have also specified that it is important that any future subsidiaries of Qantas are covered. That is also a point we have included.\n\nWe are also preventing Qantas from creating any new subsidiaries in order to shift operations overseas. Under the current Qantas Sale Act the majority of Qantas's facilities are taken in aggregate and must be located in Australia. We are referring there obviously to maintenance, administration and catering. It is very important that the majority are located in Australia but, because they are grouped together, the Qantas Sale Act gives Qantas the potential to move individual facilities offshore as long as the majority of all facilities remain in Australia. You can see that this is a very unfortunate loophole that can be exploited. For example, Qantas could send 1,999 jobs from engineering overseas while keeping 2,000 administration jobs in Australia and satisfy the act. I do not believe that is what people believe is the intention of the act. That is why we believe this needs to be tightened.\n\nThe proposal by Senator Madigan, Senator Xenophon and me would mean the majority of each of the individual facilities operated must be located here. We have spelt out what they are\u2014catering, flight operations, training, administration, maintenance and housing of the aircraft. We have heard many speeches here today detailing the importance of jobs being retained in Australia. Surely this greater clarification that our joint amendment would bring to this strengthens the important point that many senators have made.\n\nI also want to emphasise a point about any subsidiaries created. The amendment applies to any subsidiary created by Qantas after 17 July 2014, so not current subsidiaries but those post, if this happens to be passed. We believe such a provision is necessary as any delay in it coming into effect will give Qantas the opportunity to create shell companies in order to avoid being caught by the provisions of the amendment. If you look at operations to date, that is something we need to be mindful of. As the amendment applies to only future Qantas decisions about where to locate facilities, it does not require Qantas or any of its current subsidiaries to shift facilities already located outside of Australia.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nThe opposition supports this proposal.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that schedule 1, as amended, be agreed to.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question now is that schedule 2 stand as printed.\n\nQuestion negatived.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: We move to amendments (2) and (5) on sheet 7533 revised.\n\nLee Rhiannon\n\nI thought it was (4) and (2).\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: I think the revised sheet changes the numbering.\n\nI do not need to add further comments. The comments that I made when I originally spoke about the need for clarity about where these facilities are located and getting down to the division still apply. Considering the lateness of the hour, I am happy to curtail my comments.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nCan I just indicate, we have not seen these amendments. We need to at least have a couple of minutes just to get our position clarified on it.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: I think that is fair. There was a revised sheet that came round not long ago, so I am happy to facilitate that for the moment. There is another question I have to deal with administratively, which goes back to the opposition\u2014amendment (1) on sheet 7476.\n\nI move amendment (1) on sheet 7476:\n\n(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 2, column headed \"Provision(s)\"), omit \"Schedules 1 and 2\", substitute \"Schedule 1\".\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that amendment (1) on sheet 7476 be agreed to.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nLee Rhiannon\n\nby leave\u2014I move amendments (2) and (5) on sheet 7533 revised:\n\n(2) Clause 2, page 2 (at the end of the table), add:\n\n(5) Page 4 (after line 16), at the end of the bill, add:\n\nSchedule 3\u2014Facilities\n\n_Qantas Sale Act 1992_\n\n1 Subsection 3(1) (definition of _mandatory article_ )\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Repeal the definition, substitute:\n\n_\u00a0\u00a0mandatory article_ means:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(a) a provision included in Qantas' articles of association in accordance with subsection 7(1);

There is some new language there so, obviously, we are quite happy for time to be taken. I thought it was a minor change, but if we want to discuss it in committee, I am quite happy to. It is just specifying that issue of what would be captured by this. To be quite honest, it is fair to Qantas with regard to any subsidiaries. It is not about anything that has happened in the past; it is just about new subsidiaries.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nIn line with what we have said, the government's perspective is that this should not apply to Qantas subsidiaries. We think the position is very, very clear. This is about Qantas and no other corporate entity.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nLabor will not be supporting these amendments. They would appear to impose conditions on all of Qantas's subsidiaries including Jetstar, which would have significant impacts on the operation of those businesses.\n\nWhilst we are not opposed in principle to keeping as many jobs as possible in Australia, these amendments appear to have far-reaching consequences and ought to be considered very carefully. Now is not the time they can be given the serious consideration they deserve.\n\nAs I have said, we have just learnt of them recently. It would be appreciated if the senators moving them had spoken to us about their implications. Qantas and its subsidiaries are a listed company among Australia's top 100 companies by market capitalisation. While I have had major disagreements with Qantas management over the years, I believe that Qantas is entitled to be consulted over legislation that would result in Qantas having to make major changes to its business. Clearly, that has not happened with these amendments.\n\nLabor's intention in relation to this bill is to retain part 3 of the Qantas Sale Act, not to amend part 3 in the manner proposed by these amendments. That is the main game for us at the moment. That is why we will not be supporting these amendments, but we would be amenable to discussions on these amendments in the future, without committing ourselves to any outcome.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI pause to thank Senator Cameron for that very responsible approach to this. His methodology and process, in what is a very difficult and complex matter in terms of unintended consequences, is very commonsensical and I want to put on record my appreciation of that response.\n\nLee Rhiannon\n\nIt is disappointing to hear that Senator Cameron has indicated that Labor cannot support the amendments before us. Page 3 of sheet 7533 revised sets out very clearly that we are talking about Qantas subsidiaries created after 17 July 2014. So let's be clear what these amendments cover: they cover jobs, something that really has dominated the speeches by Labor senators today\u2014the very deep commitment to protect Qantas jobs. We know that the current wording can allow and has allowed Qantas to move many jobs overseas. That is why we have spelt out the different categories here with regard to catering, flight operations, training, administration, maintenance and housing of aircraft. I spelt that out before and I am spelling it out again. People need to know what they are voting for. I appreciate the issues about subsidiaries, but we have the protection. It is nothing in the past; it is not capturing that. We are talking about the future.\n\nI also acknowledge Senator Cameron's comments about time, but we all have to deal with that on the floor, and these are actually very simple amendments. To see the extent of this Labor-coalition deal is really disturbing. Here you can still achieve what you want to do, Senator Cameron, with regard to the weakening of foreign ownership, but, by working here with the Greens, the independent senators and the Palmer United Party, you could lock in greater protection of jobs. It looks like we are about to lose the vote, and that is really disappointing.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
