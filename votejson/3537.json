    "summary": "Eric Abetz\n\nI move:\n\nThat the committee does not insist on its amendments to which the House of Representatives has disagreed.\n\nThese two bills are an essential part of the government's plank of building the infrastructure of the 21st century. This is a plank which will allow us to develop literally tens of thousands of jobs over the next few years. This is the payment by the Commonwealth, in rough terms, of about $5,000 million, from which we ought to be able to leverage, courtesy of the states, about $33,000 million to develop the infrastructure to get the productivity enhancement projects that this country so desperately needs.\n\nCan I remind honourable senators that this bill in fact also allows the states to lease their assets, as opposed to a direct sale. We believe that it is important to have a fund such as this that can operate without the sorts of impediments that were imposed by the Senate's amendments. We believe that genuine productivity-enhancing investments are what this country needs, as opposed to the sorts of pink batts and school halls that we had in the past.\n\nIn summing up, can I also indicate to the Senate that we would invite, especially senators opposite, to heed the words of their shadow spokesman Mr Marles, on 18 June 2014, when asked about this particular legislation:\n\nHow could Labor stand in the way of billions, tens of billions, being spent on productive infrastructure?\n\nMr Marles's answer was:\n\n\u2026 if the amendments don't get up, we've said we're not going to stand in the way of this bill.\n\nWe would invite Labor to consider those wise words of Mr Marles. I am aware of the time constraints on the Senate. I will therefore leave my remarks at that, other than to say this is a vital part of the government's plan to get the country's economy back on track. I would urge honourable senators to reconsider their position in relation to the amendments which the Househas not agreed to.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nLabor will be insisting on all of our amendments. This goes to the proposition that the coalition argued consistently throughout their period in opposition that there has to be a proper cost-benefit analysis undertaken if we are spending billions of dollars of public money. They argued that position in opposition and we are accepting that proposition now. That proposition cannot be achieved with the proposal that has come back from the other place. There have to be checks and balances on what state governments are doing. There has to be proper analysis of and accountability for federal government money that is spent on any of these projects.\n\nI would just go back to the WestConnex project in New South Wales\u2014the road to nowhere, the road that will create more problems, the road that was simply a political promise by the coalition, and a political promise by the state government, without any cost-benefit analysis, without any analysis of what is happening in relation to roads elsewhere. I will just finish of this. I will not say a lot, because we have had this debate. The Senate takes the view that there has to be accountability on these issues, accountability on state governments and accountability on the money we spend. There has to be a cost-benefit analysis so that the projects are in the national interest, not in the political interests of a particular party. The national interest is what is important here. So I take the view and I would hope that my friends the Greens, my friends in PUP and the crossbench senators take the view that accountability is the key issue, that projects in the national interest are the key issue and that we should stand by the position that we adopted, because our position is in the national interest, not in the interests of any individual political party.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI do not want to go back and recanvass the arguments that were held last night. It was a respectful debate around forced privatisation or effectively bribing state governments to privatise state assets in exchange for Commonwealth funds. The debate was had and the Senate, I think, is upholding its role as the house of review. So we will very strongly be insisting on the amendments that we moved with the Labor Party last night.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that the motion moved by Senator Abetz that the committee not insist on its amendments be agreed to.\n\n",
