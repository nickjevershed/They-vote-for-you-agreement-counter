    "summary": "John Madigan\n\nI move:\n\nThat the Senate\u2014\n\n(a) supports the 20th anniversary of the International Day of the Family, today 15 May 2014;\n\n(b) recognises families as the foundation of our society through which our society thrives and flourishes;\n\n(c) acknowledges families are entitled to receive tax benefits to compensate for the cost of raising children including the recognition of the need for horizontal tax equity for all families; and\n\n(d) calls on the Government to:\n\n(i) ensure that families with dependent children receive adequate financial recognition for the cost of raising children, and\n\n(ii) provide equal childcare funding for all children whether they are cared for by a parent in their home or through childcare places for parents who choose to return to work.\n\nNick Xenophon\n\nby leave\u2014I move:\n\nOmit subparagraph (d)(ii).\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nJohn Hogg\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nNick Xenophon\n\nI support what Senator Madigan is attempting to do here with this motion. I think it is a very worthy motion. I am concerned about subparagraph (d)(ii) as to the implications of equal childcare funding for all children, whether they are cared for by a parent in their home or through childcare places for parents who choose to return to work. I think that the concerns of Senator Madigan are expressed in particularly (c) and (d)(i) of the motion. I have some concerns\u2014and it is not a criticism of Senator Madigan at all\u2014as to what the implications would be of equal childcare funding and how that would work. But I think what Senator Madigan is trying to do is very important in acknowledging the role of families and their being entitled to receive tax benefits to compensate for the cost of raising children.\n\nJohn Hogg\n\nThe question is that the amendment moved by Senator Xenophon be agreed to.\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nThe question now is that the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\n\nMitch Fifield\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nJohn Hogg\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nMitch Fifield\n\nThe government wishes to record its support for the 20th anniversary of the International Day of the Family. Families are the foundation of our society and its future. The contribution they make socially and economically cannot be understated. However, the government will not be supporting this motion. We believe, contrary to the sentiments of part (c) of this motion, and as reflected in the budget, that family benefits should be targeted to those who need them most. Low-income families are supported through a range of specific payments to give them the resources they need to support young children.\n\nThe government also supports measures to recognise and increase female workforce participation. These include our plan for a genuine paid parental leave scheme with replacement wage plus super and changes to family tax benefit B proposed in the budget. These changes reflect the reality that many mothers choose to return to work once their youngest child is at school. While we do endorse some of the sentiments in this motion, and certainly do support families, the government will not be supporting this motion.\n\nClaire Moore\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement.\n\nJohn Hogg\n\nLeave is granted for one minute.\n\nClaire Moore\n\nThe Labor Party strongly support the International Day of the Family, and we support the continuing discussion of the issues that are raised by this motion by Senator Madigan. But, in terms of the process, particularly around the issues of taxation, we think there needs to be a wider discussion in this area. We are happy to have that discussion, Senator Madigan, but, in terms of the motion before us, we are not able to support it in those words.\n\nJohn Hogg\n\nThe question is that the motion, as amended, be agreed to.\n\n",
