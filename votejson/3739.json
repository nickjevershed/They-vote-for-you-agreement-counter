    "summary": "Gavin Marshall\n\nSenator Hanson-Young, your amendment (7) would have been consequential on that amendment being successful, so I take it you will not proceed with amendment (7).\n\nSarah Hanson-Young\n\nThat is right.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: Thank you, Senator. Then maybe we should now move to your amendment (5) on sheet 7683.\n\nMy understanding is that was consequential as well.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question would be that part 3 of schedule 1 stand as printed.\n\nI think we will move on from that amendment if that is okay.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: Thank you.\n\nI would like to go to amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 7675. These are fairly basic amendments. They deal with removing the retrospectivity elements of this bill across all of the schedules\u20141, 2, 3 and 4. They speak for themselves. We should not, in this place, be creating legislation that is retrospective in its impact and its nature to pull the rug out from under people. It is a basic concept that we apply across the board when we are debating issues in this place that you do not make things retrospective.\n\nThese amendments are fairly simple. They just say that, from the moment that this bill passes and has royal assent, that is when these new rules will apply. We should not be trying to change the rules backwards, which is effectively what the government is doing by having these retrospective elements in the legislation. Of course, I am concerned about the very real impact that will have on asylum seekers who do have their claims already on foot. I do not think it is fair at all, but it is a broader point than that. This is actually about ensuring that we stick by the basic notion that you do not make laws in this place retrospective.\n\nBecause these amendments are all of the same nature, I seek leave to move them all together.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nI move Greens amendments (1) to (5) on sheet 7675 revised:\n\n(1) Schedule 1, item 15, page 9 (lines 3 to 12), omit subitems (1) and (2), substitute:\n\n(1) Section 5AAA of the _Migration Act 1958_ as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule applies to an application made on or after the commencement of that Part.\n\n(2) Section 5AAA of the _Migration Act 1958_ as amended by Part 1 of this Schedule also applies in relation to an administrative process starting on or after the commencement of that Part.\n\n_[Amendment (2) will only be moved if the amendments on sheets 7681 and 7682 are not agreed to.]_\n\n(2) Schedule 1, item 15, page 9 (lines 13 to 17), omit subitem (3), substitute:\n\n(3) Sections 91W, 91WA and 91WB of the _Migration Act 1958_ as amended by Part 2 of this Schedule apply to an application for a protection visa made on or after the commencement of that Part.\n\n(3) Schedule 2, item 6, page 12 (lines 21 to 30), omit subitem (2), substitute:\n\n(2) Subitem (1) covers an assessment made on or after the day this item commences.\n\n(4) Schedule 3, Part 2, page 19 (line 1) to page 20 (line 19), omit the Part, substitute:\n\nPart 2\u2014Application\n\n14 Application of amendments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to a person who arrives in Australia after the day this item commences (whether or not that person had been in Australia previously).\n\n(5) Schedule 4, item 34, page 38 (lines 2 to 32), omit the item, substitute:\n\n34 Application of amendments\n\n\u00a0\u00a0The amendments made by this Schedule apply in relation to an application to the Migration Review Tribunal or the Refugee Review Tribunal for review of a decision if the application is made on or after the commencement of this Schedule.\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nAgain, the government will not be supporting the Australian Greens amendments. These amendments in the bill, contrary to what Senator Hanson-Young has said, are not retrospective\u2014that is, they do not take effect prior to their commencement date. They operate prospectively, albeit in respect of already existing protection visa applications or administrative assessments.\n\nIn relation to proposed section 5AAA, the onus on the applicant, there is already an obligation on an asylum seeker to present all of their claims and evidence up-front. In relation to the amendments to sections 91W and 91WA, identity documents, these amendments do not change an existing obligation on the part of a person seeking protection in Australia to provide documentary evidence of identity, nationality or citizenship. In relation to new section 91WB, applications for protection visas by members of the family unit, this does not change the way the current provisions in the Migration Act operate in relation to how members of the same family unit of protection visa holders are dealt with. This amendment simply puts beyond doubt what the current interpretation of the act is.\n\nIn relation to schedule 3, making the amendments apply to new arrivals means that it will not capture UMAs or transitory persons already in Australia and living in the community who are currently section 91K barred to be instead made 46A or 46B barred. This will therefore not achieve the intended effect of schedule 3: to streamline the application bars for UMAs and transitory persons.\n\nIn relation to schedule 4, the tribunal efficiency measures, the purpose of making the amendments apply to existing applications before the tribunal is to maximise the number of applications affected by these changes, which provide increased efficiency and consistency of decision making.\n\nSarah Hanson-Young\n\nI accept the government's argument. It seemed a bit muddled\u2014both prospective in its nature and impacting on things that have already happened. It seems to be retrospective in my understanding of the term. I am disappointed that the government continue to pretend that this is not retrospective. It clearly is. The reason it is is that they want it to impact on as many people as possible. It is simply not fair. I accept, though, that the government have not listened to that argument.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that the amendments moved by Senator Hanson-Young be agreed to.\n\n",
