    "summary": "Jacqui Lambie\n\nI ask leave to move a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business order of the day No. 52 for private senators' bills relating to the Defence Force Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014.\n\nLeave not granted.\n\nPursuant to contingent notice, I move:\n\nThat so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Lambie moving a motion relating to the conduct of business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business order of the day No. 52 for private senators' bills relating to the Defence Force Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014.\n\nEric Abetz\n\nThe government does not support the suspension of standing orders. We are now in the last two days of the parliamentary sitting. There is an orderly agenda before us and I simply put to senators that if we are going to have, yet again, another hijacking of the agenda in this the last week as a result of various coalitions of convenience across the chamber, I think we are doing ourselves a disservice in the management of not only this place but also the agenda and the matters the Australian people wish us to deal with.\n\nLet us not fabricate any difference in this place about who cares for the welfare of the Australian Defence Force. We all do. As a cabinet minister I live with that responsibility every day, as does the Prime Minister and as does the Minister for Defence. I trust we all live with that responsibility.\n\nThe reality is, in relation to Defence pay, that Australia is burdened with an interest bill of $1,000 million a month, and that is being borrowed simply to pay the interest on the debt that has already been sustained. All spending has to be sustainable, even Defence spending. It is just not feasible to borrow even more money to pay for higher wages. The government needs to find an additional $16,000 million just to replace that which Labor stripped out of Defence during their six years in government.\n\nIn answer to a question earlier this week, I indicated what the CPI increases were and what the actual wage increases were for the Public Service, and over the last decade there was a differential of 14 per cent\u2014the wage increases being 42 per cent and CPI 28 per cent. In relation to the ADF, just on wages the differential is some 10 per cent, and that does not take into account the, in general terms, quite generous allowances that do come with Defence Force service.\n\nI also say to honourable senators who might be attracted to this proposition that the Remuneration Tribunal itself has said that it has a long-held view that setting remuneration for one office by reference to another office does not lead to defensible or meaningful wage outcomes. If we want to start setting wages in this place, we can get rid of the Fair Work Commission, get rid of the Remuneration Tribunal and get rid of the Defence Force Remuneration Tribunal.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nYou're trying to get rid of it anyway!\n\nStephen Parry\n\nOrder on my left!\n\nEric Abetz\n\nWe get a churlish, silly interjection, as we always expect, from Senator Cameron, but does he actually want the parliament to set wages? That is the issue\u2014and now he falls silent. Of course he does not want to. If we do not want the parliament to set wages, then we should not come rushing in here with populist agendas to try to get wage increases. It is interesting that in this bill we do not have the reverse\u2014that parliamentary salaries should, as a matter of fact, be linked to CPI. The financial situation in this country, regrettably, meant that I was duty-bound on behalf of the government to go to the Remuneration Tribunal and say that parliamentarians, secretaries, the Chief of the Defence Force and the Minister for Defence must all have any wage increases that were to come to them frozen and, for this coming year, set at zero. Why did we do that? Because the money simply is not there. When we seek to make more generous payments to anyone in Australia, that money first has to come out of the pocket of one of our fellow Australians.\n\nIn summary, there is an agenda that needs to be dealt with here. We do not want the parliament setting people's wages when there are remuneration tribunals and other tribunals designed to do that. I invite senators to oppose the motion. _(Time expired)_\n\nJacqui Lambie\n\nMr President, I seek leave to speak on the motion.\n\nLeave not granted.\n\nPenny Wong\n\nMr President, I seek leave to make a one-minute statement.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nI would ask the government to reconsider the courtesy. The senator thought she would be called again after the motion was moved. It was a genuine mistake. Regardless of what people's views are about the merits of the motion, it is Senator Lambie's motion and I would invite the government to extend a little courtesy to allow the senator to speak on the motion she has moved. It would be very churlish not to, I would suggest.\n\nEric Abetz\n\nI seek leave to make a one-minute statement.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nMr President, regrettably, Senator Lambie's former party has form in this place of moving procedural and other motions and not speaking to them by design. That is what we thought Senator Lambie was doing yet again, and now Senator Wong sees a genuine mistake without even having spoken to Senator Lambie. So here we are, having the opposition championing on the cause of Senator Lambie. Senator Lambie has now been in this place for a number of months and should be aware of the procedures. If Senator Lambie did not know that she should have spoken to her motion when she moved it, so be it. Let her acknowledge that. As the government we would be prepared to extend the courtesy to her.\n\nJacqui Lambie\n\nI seek leave to make a short statement for a minute to explain.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nI have to say that I thought I would get a chance to speak on this, but obviously Senator Abetz has jumped straight up\u2014there is no doubt about that. Out of common courtesy\u2014\n\nEric Abetz\n\nYou sat down.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nOrder on my right. Senator Lambie has a right to speak. Order on my left as well. Senator Cameron. Senator Conroy.\n\nJacqui Lambie\n\nI do not apologise to Senator Abetz. I doubt that in his first 5\u00bd months he put up a bill. I do not have a big party behind me and so I do not have that impact. I am asking you to give me a fair go and show me some courtesy over this and let me speak for five minutes. More importantly, this is not about me; this is about the men and women who wear the uniform. You know it and I know it. The reason you do not want me to speak is that you are blocking the remuneration package of $121 million that these men and women are looking for. You have a part in taking away this money away from them. Not allowing me five minutes on the floor is all over\u2014over the ego of your own party and yourself.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nBefore I move to anyone else, I want to clarify what exactly has happened in this chamber. Senator Lambie sought the call, and leave was denied. Then Senator Lambie, and it is her right, moved a motion to suspend standing orders. I particularly noted Senator Lambie sitting down; I paused; then Senator Abetz rose to his feet and he spoke. In fact, I started to call the question, thinking no-one was going to speak. That is exactly what happened and let us not have a different portrayal of events. Everyone has legitimately sought the call and been given the call at the appropriate time. Now we have the situation where leave, I understand, has now been granted for Senator Lambie to speak for five minutes, because Senator Lambie has indicated that she inadvertently made a mistake. Senator Lambie, you have the call.\n\nJacqui Lambie\n\nThe Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 is a critical and important piece of legislation, which deserves precedence and priority to the other general business of this Senate. As the title of the bill indicates, if this legislation is passed by this parliament, it will guarantee that the men and women of our Defence Force receive a fair pay rise, rather than an effective pay cut in the near future\u2014perhaps before Christmas.\n\nApart from Liberal and National Party members, who have wrong-headed priorities and twisted loyalties to political parties and who have not fought hard enough in their party rooms for their ADF families, who would want to stop this parliament from immediately debating and passing legislation that provides a solution to the ADF pay crisis, created by Australia's Prime Minister and Defence Minister? What debate could be more important than a debate that fundamentally affects the national security of Australia? If we do not have national security, then we do not have anything.\n\nAs the Senate, we daily choose to debate to pass or not legislation which affects education, health, social security, TPV, RETs, the sky-rocketing costs of electricity and fuel and the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme. But if our nation is not properly secure and our Defence Force has been weakened, either by incompetence or by design, then the best health, education, social security systems in the world will ultimately be off little value to the nation.\n\nOrdinary Tasmanians and Australians 100 per cent support the men and women of our Defence Forces 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. That is unlike some in this chamber, who by their actions or lack of actions and their silence and cowardly behaviour in their party rooms choose to live off the Anzac legend rather than live up to the Anzac legend.\n\nI am looking forward to hearing every word, every syllable and every sentence of those members of this Senate who choose to deny this chamber a debate this morning on the fair pay of members of the Australian Defence Forces, with the help of a magnificent Hansard team, who skilfully record our words for Australia's history. I will make sure that every full-time member of our Army, Navy and RAAF, approximately 57,000 souls; all of their families and friends; the 20,000 reservists and all their family and friends; and every one of our 200,000 veterans out there and their all of their families and friends\u2014all of those Australians, hundreds of thousands, perhaps even millions\u2014will get an opportunity to read or hear the poor excuses of those in this Senate who oppose a debate about a fair pay deal for our diggers this morning.\n\nThe facts before this chamber are clear. Earlier this week, I meet with Mr Tony Dagger. He is the father of a serving Australian Defence Force member. Mr Dagger presented me, the opposition leader and other members of this parliament with a petition containing almost 60,000 signatures calling on this government to fix the Australian Defence Force pay injustice. Apart from Mr Dagger and his petition supporters, the hundreds and thousands of phone calls and emails to my office and to other senators offices prove why we should have this debate right now.\n\nImportantly, the hundreds of troops serving overseas, who are in harm's way for our benefit and who have been absolutely gutted by this government's and this Prime Minister's decision to take away $17 million of leave and entitlements and then give back the $17 million, are still facing a future with an effective pay cut. Those Australian Defence Force members and their families would like to hear the news of a debate on the Defence Amendment (Fair Pay for Members of the ADF) Bill 2014 today\u2014not a day later and not an hour later. Right now, this government and their members must explain to Australian people why they cannot afford to invest an extra $121 million dollars a year\u2014that is it\u2014into the pay of the men and women of our Defence Force.\n\nThe time has now come for the senators in this chamber to live up to the Anzac legend and not off it.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
