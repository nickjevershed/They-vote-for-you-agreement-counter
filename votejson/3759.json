This is a politically driven motion moved by those who are fundamentally opposed to the government's offshore processing policies. The allegations referred to in this motion have been extensively investigated independently by Mr Philip Moss, the former Integrity Commissioner and former head of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement and Integrity. The Moss inquiry was a comprehensive investigation which drew information from a wide range of stakeholders, including Serco and the Australian Federal Police. The department has accepted all of Mr Moss's in 19 recommendations and has only just commenced implementing its responses. The department will continue to have discussions with the government of Nauru on the best way forward to implement the investigation's recommendations.\n\nStephen Parry\n\nThe question is that general business notice of motion No. 698, standing in the names of Senator Gallacher and Senator Hanson-Young, be agreed to.\n\n",
