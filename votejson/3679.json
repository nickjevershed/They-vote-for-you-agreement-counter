    "summary": "Gavin Marshall\n\nThe question now is that Palmer United Party amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7618 revised be agreed to.\n\nChristine Milne\n\nI am glad that Senator Wang is here, because it would be good for him to answer some questions about his own amendment, which he has not spoken on at all. He has moved it but has not been here for the debate at all. I have put some questions to the minister that he has refused to answer, so I now put those questions to Senator Wang since it is his amendment. Number 1: the University of New South Wales has indicated in its submission that it will see a substantial reduction in its research effort if this legislation is to pass and that in fact 30 per cent of its research effort currently relies on what the university gets in relation to this particular provision on research and development. I would like to ask Senator Wang: what consultation have you had with universities around the country as to the impact of this legislation on their research effort? I can ask through you, Mr Chairman\u2014\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: Senator Milne, could you resume your seat.\n\nBarry O'Sullivan\n\nMr Chairman, I rise on a point of order. I seek clarification from the chair on this issue. The time of the Senate is valuable, and I know of no capacity or precedent for one senator to seek a question of another senator in the chamber.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: It is quite in order, Senator O'Sullivan. There is no point of order.\n\nChristine Milne\n\nIt is quite normal practice in the committee state of a bill, if someone raises an amendment and puts it to the Senate, for them to speak to their own amendments, so I am putting this question very clearly.\n\nUniversities around the country, in conjunction with institutions like the CSIRO and with small businesses, benefit enormously from large corporations spending money in the research and development area. So I am asking: what consultation has been done with universities around the country, for a start, as to what impact this will have, firstly, on their research effort and, secondly, on CSIRO?\n\nI think this is critical. We are seeing $1.1 billion taken out of research and development, and I think that the person who is moving for this particular change to the way that this would be determined should answer some questions about the consultation on the impact on the universities, since the government will not. We know that the government wrote the amendment for Senator Wang, but nevertheless it is his amendment, and I would like an answer to the question from either the minister or Senator Wang.\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nSenator Milne, who is clearly trying to keep the filibuster going for a bit longer, is misleading the Senate, because I did answer that question. What I said very clearly is that this measure, which was initiated and banked in Labor's last budget by the previous Gillard Labor government, has been subject to consultation with the most important people of all\u2014that is, the Australian people at the last election. I know that the Greens do not like the result at the last election. I know that the Greens do not like democracy, but that is the system of government that we are operating under here in Australia.\n\nSo what has happened here is that the government sought to implement Labor's budget measure, which has broadly the same fiscal impact. Actually, our saving now is slightly less than what the saving would have been if Labor's measure had been implemented. So, to the extent that there is an impact, it is going to be a lesser impact than it would have been under Labor's original proposal. But what we have agreed with Senator Wang and the Palmer United Party, after very constructive engagement, is to make this change in a better way\u2014in a way that is fairer for businesses generating most of their profits in Australia, vis-a-vis those businesses operating in Australia who generate a significant part of their profits in other parts of the world.\n\nThe Palmer United Party\u2014Senator Wang in particular\u2014in relation to this legislation has taken a very constructive approach. The Labor Party and the Greens have taken a very destructive approach. I do not understand why the Greens all of a sudden now are shedding crocodile tears when they did not shed crocodile tears when the Labor Party was pursuing this. The impact of this measure now is a lesser impact than it would have been under the Gillard Labor government proposal\u2014the Gillard Labor government, of course, having been a government that enjoyed the confidence and the support of the Australian Greens party.\n\nKim Carr\n\nWe need to correct the record yet again. This is an entirely different proposal, Minister, for which notice has not been given.\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nThe Senate is amending it.\n\nKim Carr\n\nYou have written this amendment. It is your amendment, in effect. But it is an entirely different proposal, and you cannot possibly seek to misrepresent the position in this chamber.\n\nChristine Milne\n\nIt is an entirely different proposal. But, regardless, the Greens did not support taking $1.1 billion out of the research and development budget under the last government, and we do not support it under this government. In particular, what we have had from the minister is complete contempt for the Senate. He has been asked a direct question about what consultation he had with the universities. The fact is that there has been none, because all he can come up with is the same rhetoric from the bad government that has been in for so long. The good government that is supposed to have taken its place has not made its way to the Senate, because we are getting the same rubbish: that the Australian people are the people he consulted, not the universities.\n\nYou never do that when it comes to any other bit of legislation. You talk about your stakeholders. You go and ask the people who are going to be impacted. The universities are going to be impacted. CSIRO is going to be impacted. Every research institution in the country is going to be impacted by this. You are going to see a lot of research dollars go off overseas. More particularly, the decision to slash the universities and CSIRO, and now to take $1.1 billion out of the research funding, means that you are going to have a lot of small, innovative companies in Australia not having access to research dollars, and universities are going to be undermined in their research efforts, and it is going to be down to you, the Palmer United Party and other people on the crossbench who vote for it.\n\nMark my words: when AusBiotech and the universities find out what you have done, they are going to be horrified. But I am not surprised, because, as I said earlier, the Vandals have come over the wall. They are going back to the Dark Ages. It is anti-science, anti-research and anti-rationalism. We are going back to intuition, as Senator Cormann said last night in response to why he would not accept my amendment on quarterly payments: it was intuitive. So now we are into intuition and fairytales, because there is no consultation about what is going on in terms of the impact on the universities. I feel really sad, because we will see PhD students and innovative companies done out of research dollars by people who do not know what they are doing, do not know what they have put to the Senate and cannot stand up and actually argue their case.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that Palmer United Party amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7618, revised, be agreed to.\n\nThe committee divided. [18:09]\n\n(The Chairman\u2014Senator Marshall)\n\nQuestion agreed to.\n\nBill, as amended, agreed to.\n\nBill reported with amendment; report adopted.\n\n",
