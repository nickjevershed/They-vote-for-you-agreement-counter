    "summary": "Alex Gallacher\n\nThe Senate is considering amendments (1) and (2) on sheet 7618 moved by Senator Wang and amendment (1) on sheet 7650 moved by Senator Carr to Senator Wang's amendment (2).\n\nKim Carr\n\nBefore question time I was asking the minister what impact the retrospective nature of this bill would have on companies and, in particular, about the issue of companies that seek pre-approvals of their work, which of course is standard practice. I was making the point that in the cases of companies like CSL strategic investment decisions have already been taken based on the advice received. So I would ask the minister: how many firms have received advanced approval for R&D spends in 2015-16 from AusIndustry?\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nActually, it is not technically an approval, because you only qualify for relevant incentives once relevant expenditure has occurred, consistent with the requirements in the legislation. What relevant businesses are required to do is preregister the activity that they might want to make a claim in relation to. That is all.\n\nI note that Senator Carr does not accept responsibility at all, even though he was a minister in the Gillard and Rudd governments, which put this measure on the table and which had it as part of their pre-election costings in the lead-up to the last election. He does not accept any responsibility for the fact that this is a measure which was announced in 2013-14 in Labor's last budget, with a starting date of 1 July 2013. We have delayed the starting date by one year, to 1 July 2014, in recognition of the fact that delays caused by Labor against the implementation of their own budget measure have made that necessary. The practical effect is that this will only impact on companies lodging tax returns after 1 July 2015. It is a measure which was announced in 2013. It will not impact on businesses until after 1 July 2015, which is very much prospective. There cannot be any doubt that relevant businesses in the marketplace had very good notice of the government's intentions in relation to this particular change.\n\nKim Carr\n\nThe fact is that businesses cannot have good notice of the government's intention, because this is an entirely separate matter. Senator Wang, despite the fact that you have written these amendments and despite the fact that they are, in effect, your amendments, they have never, ever been announced as government policy. So how can you possibly say that companies had notice of these proposals? These are entirely separate matters from those that were considered before the Senate committee. These are new measures. You have effectively sought to fundamentally change the nature of this bill and this proposal. You make broad assumptions and broad assertions as to the equivalence of these measures. The evidence has not been produced that that is the case. Not one scrap of evidence has been put forward as to the nature of these changes in terms of their similarity to previous government announcements. This is despite the fact that, for all intents and purposes, these are now government amendments.\n\nThe government has effectively written these amendments. We have not heard from the proponents\u2014in name\u2014of these. We have not heard a word about it. What we do know is that they were prepared in Treasury for a senator in this place, which you have all confirmed in these matters before a briefing and before the committee, and you have confirmed those propositions in this chamber. I would ask you, Minister: where is the officer from AusIndustry to advise you on this question? Which of these officers here is from AusIndustry?\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nLet's be very clear. The government's preference is to implement and to legislate the measure as introduced, which is Labor's measure. And if Senator Carr prefers Labor's measure, which is to remove the additional tax incentives for R&D for businesses generating more than $20 billion in assessable income per year\u2014if that is his preference\u2014tell us now, and the government will be joining with Labor to pass Labor's budget measure. Now, if Labor is not prepared to do this, then, quite frankly, the shadow minister should get out of the Senate's way and let the Senate deal with this legislation the way the Senate wants to deal with it.\n\nThe government accepts that we do not have the numbers in this chamber, and the government accepts that we are not able to get our preferred methodology through the Senate. What we have done is accept a request that was made by the crossbench for some adjustments, and I have explained on the record, ad nauseam now, how those changes will impact. And it is absolutely right to say that the fiscal impact, the beneficial impact on the budget bottom line, will be broadly similar. The number of companies impacted will be broadly similar. There will be some differences, because there is an additional fairness protection putting businesses generating most of their profits in Australia on an equal footing with businesses generating some of their profits in Australia but more profits overseas\u2014put them on an equal footing. We think that is fair. We have accepted it. It is not our amendment; it is the Palmer United Party amendment. But the government is prepared to accept it. But if the Labor Party is telling us that they prefer their original budget saving, we are all ears. We are quite happy to deal with it very quickly. If Senator Carr is telling us now that he likes the budget saving that former Prime Minister Gillard and former Treasurer Swan put forward, as part of a government that he was a minister in, then let's do it.\n\nKim Carr\n\nI will ask again\u2014and I take it, given that you have not been able to tell me that there is an AusIndustry officer here: how many firms received advance approval for R&D spends in 2015-16 from AusIndustry, who will now be adversely affected by these measures?\n\nThe minister shakes his head. You refuse to answer? Or you do not know? Are you confessing to your profound ignorance yet again? Once again, your demonstrate your contempt for this chamber. You simply do not know the answer. That is the truth of the matter. You have not had the relevant officers here to be able to advise you. I can understand that a minister does not necessarily follow every element of the administration of this issue. But you should at least have the relevant officers here to tell you how many occasions a company has been given pre-approval, which is now being effectively rescinded by your unilateral actions to introduce measures that are effectively government sponsored measures, without notice. This is an application of retrospectivity to the taxation law which on any standard would not be acceptable in any normal circumstances.\n\nThe CHAIRMAN: The question is that opposition amendment (1) on sheet 7650 be agreed to.\n\n",
