    "summary": "Peter Whish-Wilson\n\nI want to begin by focusing on the issue of the definition of a small business. We have heard today that there are numerous definitions for small businesses. It is obviously something that deserves a wider discussion and a wider debate. I note that when we in this chamber debated and passed legislation for a tax cut for small business and for depreciation allowances to be raised significantly on assets we used a $2 million-turnover threshold. Originally the government had proposed a tax cut for small businesses with a threshold of less than $5 million, if my memory serves me correctly\u2014certainly, that was what was put out into the media\u2014and later that was changed to $2 million. The Greens have always used a $2 million-turnover threshold in our policy on small business, but I understand the ABS and ASIC use a threshold of 15 or 20 employees. Senator Xenophon raised a point in relation to the Australian Bankers' Association's submission around the potential for financial securities firms with fewer employees to be writing literally tens of millions of dollars, if not more, in revenue\u2014for example, they could be working on derivatives.\n\nWe also have the very obvious situation arising now in the new economy. Senator McKim is not here, but he is a big fan of the shared economy. We have seen virtual businesses, like Uber and others, that are low-employee businesses, generating billions of dollars of revenue. I think this is something we need to consider. My question to the minister is: will your five-year review include looking at potential uses or abuses of this system by businesses that in revenue terms are obviously significantly larger businesses than most small businesses? Will you consider, in line with some of the submissions we have seen, reducing the time frame for conducting your post-implementation review to two years rather than five years? If not, can you explain why five years is appropriate?\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nIn response to the final question, the five-year review period that is contained in the legislation is an outer limit. It is open to the government to conduct the review sooner. I do not think we would want to do it too soon, before we had a reasonable amount of lived experience to make an informed judgement as to whether and to what extent there ought to be further improvements to the framework that has been put in place through this legislation.\n\nThe other issue that Senator Whish-Wilson raised was about the definition of a small business. When you pursue a tax cut for small business, the assessable income levels are not necessarily a key determiner when it comes to drawing a line in the sand as to who is in and who is out. But for the purposes of this exercise of extending to small business protections that are generally available to consumers, in the context of unfair contract terms, our advice, and what has come out of the consultation process, is that the easiest way for small business to apply an appropriate test is to look at the headcount\u2014and that is what I said in my summing-up speech. 'Businesses with less than 20 employees' has been chosen by the government for the definition as it is a commonly used headcount measure and has been found by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to provide a good proxy for a small business. The headcount approach is also considered the easiest for small business to implement. If you wanted to apply to this context any other indicator, as legitimate as it might be in the context of the tax system, you would add a further complication to the way the proposed protections in this legislation would be applied to small businesses, and that is certainly not something that the government would want to do.\n\nPeter Whish-Wilson\n\nCould I move to the issue of the transaction value thresholds. From reading the explanatory memorandum, I understand that a survey was conducted which, over a period of months, talked to small businesses and collated data and information on what might constitute a threshold that would be useful for this bill in respect of the unfair contract terms that we are looking at. The value that the government has come up with is $100,000 within a year and $250,000 over a longer period of time. Can you confirm that that would cover 80 per cent of the businesses you surveyed and whether you feel that the other 20 per cent, who would still constitute small businesses, would unfairly miss out if we were to have in place a transaction value threshold that did not incorporate the majority of small businesses.? I refer you to the use of the word 'most' in paragraph 1.13 of the draft explanatory material, which stated:\n\nThe consultation process indicated the preferred transaction value threshold would encompass most small business transactions.\n\nMathias Cormann\n\nI thank Senator Whish-Wilson. The first point I would make is a correction to what the senator has just said: we are not excluding any small business. If you are a small business with up to 20 employees, you are eligible for this extended protection from unfair contract terms, which at present is only available to consumers.\n\nThis is ultimately a matter of balance. What we have said is that we only propose to extend this protection from unfair contract terms to transactions of up to $100,000 when they are payable under a contract of 12 months or less and $250,000 for the up-front price payable under a contract for more than 12 months. Obviously, this is a matter of balance. It does cover 80 per cent of small business transactions. In the context of the small businesses and the stakeholders that we have surveyed, the threshold is set to provide the right balance between giving small business confidence to engage in contracts while encouraging them to seek legal advice for more substantial contracts.\n\nObviously, when you make a decision to extend to business a protection that, historically, has only applied to consumers, you do need to draw a line somewhere in order to ensure that you do not go too far. The current figure was the product of very extensive consultation with the sector about what would be a suitable way to capture most day-to-day contracts. The thresholds take into account that lengthy consultation with industry. Our consultation included liaison with the states and territories, and they all endorsed that figure. Our bill, in its current form, gives small business protections that they have never had. Amendments that force this back to consultation could derail this process and, therefore, prevent small businesses from enjoying these benefits. I would have thought that it would be better to get this bill through, see how it operates in practice and then make a judgement on what further adjustments may or may not be appropriate after the review, which has to take place within a five-year period.\n\nI know that Senator Whish-Wilson has flagged an amendment to essentially increase the threshold of the up-front price payable under a contract of 12 months or less from $100,000 to $300,000 and to increase the up-front price payable under a contract of more than 12 months from $250,000 to $1 million. The government will not be able to support these amendments. Indeed, if the amendments carried, we would not be able to support the amended bill in that form in the House of Representatives, which would mean a delay in this additional protection, which we are proposing to put in place for small businesses in appropriate circumstances\u2014namely, in the context of contracts of up to $100,000 where the up-front price is payable under a contract of 12 months or less and up to $250,000 where the up-front price is payable under a contract of more than 12 months. So I would encourage the Senate to keep that in mind.\n\nI understand the argument that Senator Whish-Wilson is putting forward. Ultimately, it is a matter of judgement; it is a matter of balance. We believe that we got the balance right, based on the extensive consultation that we have conducted. Ultimately, the safeguard is that there is a review due to take place down the track, so we will be able to reassess as to whether there ought to be an adjustment to where that line in the sand is drawn. I would very much urge the Senate today to support this bill, as proposed by the government, in order to get this additional protection for small business underway as soon as possible and for us to have a conversation about what further improvements might be made down the track at a later stage.\n\nPeter Whish-Wilson\n\nI notice a number of stakeholders said that they were disappointed with the legislation\u2014obviously, there are criticisms in different areas\u2014simply about the fact that it did not meet the spirit of the government's promise, going to the last election, that they would extend to small business these contract terms from consumer law. For example, the Australian Newsagents Federation said:\n\nThe majority of Newsagents have approx. 6-8 main multi-year contracts \u2026\n\nThey also talk about their lease agreements being long-term lease agreements and say:\n\nThese contracts will in most cases be excluded by the current bill thresholds. These are the contracts that can often lack equity, that cause small business owners stress, and that can also restrict their control to manage their own businesses.\n\nThese are important submissions that are made by key stakeholders in this debate. They also raise concerns about a number of issues in relation to what constitutes the up-front price payable in the UCT Bill and they make some suggestions there about amendments to the legislation that we have here in front of us. They also talk about exempting the up-front price of the goods and services and exempting the main subject matter of the contract. There are a number of exemptions that we could have sought today to finetune this bill. I accept the minister's assertion that these are things that could be reviewed in two years time or in five years time. But I think this issue, where we could simply extend the transaction value threshold from $100,000 to $300,000, will not do anything to impact the legislation. It should not have any issues across the small business community. I notice a number of groups that represent larger businesses put up criticisms of this bill; they do not want to see it happen. I think this is a very simple one for us to do here today. It would be very disappointing if the government did not show any flexibility in this regard. These are, I think, very good amendments that we can say, now, with confidence will capture 95 per cent of small businesses in this country, which is much more in the spirit of what the government promised when it promised this legislation going into the last election. It would be an easy thing to do.\n\nI think it is threatening the Senate, as you have just done, Senator Cormann, to say that it will be on our heads if this legislation gets rejected by the upper house in this country, when actually what we are asking to do is very simple and would improve the bill, and it probably has majority support in the Senate. I would ask what particular issue you have with extending this to $300,000. In asking you that, I would like you to consider another thing that the Australian Newsagents Federation said in their submission:\n\n\u2026 in the exposure draft explanatory material \u2018context of amendments\u2019 1.7, it argued a rationale that higher value thresholds should be excluded on the basis that, \u2018\u2018it may be reasonable to expect that they (small businesses) undertake appropriate due diligence (such as seeking legal advice)\u2019, and that, \u2018the onus on small businesses to undertake due diligence when entering into high-value contracts\u2019 should be maintained. It is overly simplistic and ingenuous to assume that by taking legal advice and doing due diligence that a small business operator will necessarily be able to inject equity and fairness into their contracting relationships with several multinational organisations who they contract with, or to easily walk away without losing their business, particularly on renewal. This is unrealistic when the more powerful party may use their market power to be particularly inflexible.\n\nThey do state in their submission that the majority of their standard form contracts are for over $100,000, yet under your definition they constitute small businesses, with newsagents being employers of just a few people. So why is this an example here, where essentially your legislation is take it or leave it? Can you address those concerns?\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
