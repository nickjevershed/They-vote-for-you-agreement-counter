    "summary": "Janet Rice\n\nby leave\u2014I move Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7495 revised:\n\n(5) Subsection (4) does not limit the matters to which the Minister may have regard in determining whether to approve the provision of Commonwealth funding for the project.\n\n4C Cost benefit analyses to be made public\n\n(1) The Minister must ensure that the following information about a Black Spot Project, Heavy Vehicle Safety and Productivity Project, Investment Project or Transport Development and Innovation Project is made available on the Department's website, if Commonwealth funding is provided for the project:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(a) a description of the project;\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(b) when the project is to start and is likely to be completed;\n\n(c) Infrastructure Australia's evaluation of the project under subsection 4B(2) (if applicable);\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(d) any advice given by Infrastructure Australia in relation to the project as mentioned in paragraph 4B(4)(c).\n\n(2) The information must be published no later than 14 days after the Commonwealth first informs a recipient of the funding that Commonwealth funding will be provided for the project.\n\n(6) Schedule 1, item 14, page 7, after proposed section 4C, insert:\n\n4D Cost benefit analyses of other projects\n\n(1) Infrastructure Australia must give to the Minister a cost benefit analysis of a land transport infrastructure project if:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(a) Commonwealth funding is provided for the project (under this Act or any other law) on or after the commencement of this section (whether the provision of the funding was agreed to, approved or announced before, on or after that commencement); and\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(b) capital expenditure on the project is $50 million or more; and\n\n(c) Infrastructure Australia is not required to give a cost benefit analysis of the project to the Minister under another provision of this Act.\n\n(2) The Minister must ensure that the cost benefit analysis is made available on the Department's website.\n\nThese amendments amend the bill so that for any project of $50 million or more in capital expenditure, the minister must have regard to the Infrastructure Australia evaluation of the project. The evaluation of the project must include a cost-benefit analysis, the priority of the project as per Infrastructure Australia's infrastructure plan and any other relevant matter, and the evaluation must be made available on the department's website. If there is any Commonwealth funding for the project, the department website must make information available with the description of the project, time lines, the advice by the Infrastructure Australia and the evaluation.\n\nWe have suggested the $50 million benchmark because this was the benchmark that was in the recommendation of the Productivity Commission report in the public infrastructure, which was undertaken this year. In the report, they stated:\n\nAll governments should commit to subjecting all public infrastructure investment proposals above $50 million to rigorous cost\u2013benefit analyses that are publicly released \u2026\n\nWe think that moving these amendments to this bill is a very good opportunity to put this recommendation into legislation. Accountability and making sure that investment in transport infrastructure is cost-effective is incredibly important because, when you are investing in transport, we have got a limited budget. We have got to make sure that they are being spent in the most appropriate way possible. That is what this amendment is seeking to achieve with these important investments that are going to be made into our transport infrastructure.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nLabor opposes Green's amendment (5). Labor has opposition amendment (7), which is a copy with slight changes. Labor supports $100 million as the mandatory threshold for Infrastructure Australia evaluation. Black spots, heavy vehicles and transport innovation projects are never anywhere near $50 million, let alone $100 million. The $50 million is almost the entire annual allocation to these entire programs, let alone individual projects. This is the point that the government has made and which the opposition has accepted in drafting this alternative amendment. Labor supports the majority of the content in principle but we prefer our amendment.\n\nThe transparency provision proposed new (4c) is the same as opposition (5). We prefer that amendment and we will vote accordingly. In relation to Greens amendment (6), Labor does not support it but agrees with its intent. However, the amendment appears to duplicate other provisions and is not clearly drafted. Labor has an alternative amendment relating to Infrastructure Australia's assessments or projects which it will support.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nAs is my practice, I would like to commence by setting out what the government's voting intentions are. I am very pleased to hear that the opposition are opposing the Greens amendments (5) and (6) on sheet 7495. The bad news is that opposition amendments (5) and (7) will also be opposed by the government.\n\nIn my summing-up, I think I set out the significance of why we are opposed to that, and Senator Cameron has gone a long way towards setting out very good reasons why Greens amendment (5) should be opposed. The amendments require the minister\u2014in talking about the broad thrust of all of the amendments, (5) and (7) of the opposition's also\u2014to consult with Infrastructure Australia prior to approving a project under the act, including Infrastructure Australia providing an evaluation for projects with a capital expenditure of $100 million or more. The evaluation is to include a cost-benefit analysis of the program.\n\nInterestingly, the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill, recently passed, had a mechanism that would have enabled Infrastructure Australia to provide advice on projects over the $100 million threshold, but the amendments moved by the opposition and the Greens actually delete it. They did not want the minister to have directional powers over Infrastructure Australia. Yet, in order to achieve the outcome that they want here, the opposition and the Greens require the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia to give him information.\n\nWe need to be clear\u2014either it is acceptable for the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia or it is not. The amendments that are being proposed here require the minister to direct Infrastructure Australia. Having said that and having spelt out the reasons for our opposition, I confirm again that we will be opposed to each of these Greens amendments as similar as they are to opposition amendments (5) and (7) on sheet 7477.\n\nJanet Rice\n\nI had a question regarding this for Senator Johnston. In terms of the cost-benefit analysis and the inclusion of that in the Infrastructure Australia Amendment Bill\u2014given the importance of the cost-benefit analysis, the commitment to the cost-benefit analysis for projects over $100 million, what really is the problem with including it in this bill? The Land Transport Infrastructure Amendment Bill is an overarching bill pulling together funding for transport. I really cannot see the problem of including the cost-benefit analysis in this bill. It really seems to fit here and this is where it belongs.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nIt is in the Infrastructure Australia Act, where it should be. It was part of an election promise to do that. It is not relevant to what this bill seeks to do, as I attempted to set out in my summing up with respect to the second reading debate.\n\nPeter Whish-Wilson\n\nThe question is that amendments (5) and (6) be agreed to.\n\nQuestion negatived.\n\nSenator Rice, are you interested in moving amendment (7), to schedule 1, item 20?\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nThere has been some unofficial discussions between the opposition and the Greens, and I am sure that the government would understand: what we were looking at doing was maybe continuing to deal with the program as outlined. But we would have no problem if the chair felt that it would assist the process to deal with this issue now.\n\nPeter Whish-Wilson\n\nAs the chamber chooses.\n\nJanet Rice\n\nI move amendment (7) on sheet 7495:\n\nSchedule 1, item 20, page 9 (line 9), omit \"or safety\", substitute \", safety, integration or environmental sustainability\".\n\nThis amendment incorporates into the purposes of what is to be funded whether it is appropriate to approve a project. There is a whole list of criteria currently in the bill, matters to which the minister may have regard in deciding whether it is appropriate to approve a project as an investment project. One of them, in the existing proposed bill, is the extent to which the project would improve the efficiency, security or safety of transport operations. This amendment would change that so that it became 'efficiency, security, safety, integration of environmental sustainability' of transport operations\u2014so, including the terms 'integration' and 'environmental sustainability'.\n\nWe think this would bring it into line with what is basically standard practice across the country and would reflect all economic, social and environmental criteria. For example, the Victorian Transport Integration Act has a vision statement that says that the aspiration of Victorians for an integrated and sustainable transport system is that it contributes to an inclusive, prosperous and environmentally responsible state. I think including those things\u2014transport integration, making sure that our transport systems are working effectively together, all supporting each other\u2014is a very important concept when you are talking about what we should be investing in for transport. And environmental sustainability, as part of a trio of looking at environmental sustainability, economic sustainability and social responsibility, really should be there in the purposes for any investment in transport infrastructure.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nWe are opposed to this amendment\u2014more red tape, more cost, more administrative requirements on government. I take it we are not moving (8), (1) to (4), and (9); we are dealing with just (7) on 7495, in which case: obviously we would want to fully oppose this worthy opposition to support it. But I will leave it to my learned friend across the aisle to understand what that really means in practical terms.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nThat is the nicest thing you have ever said about me! Labor has had some detailed discussion with the Australian Greens about this amendment. We will not support the amendment. We would prefer to add 'integrated' alone, as we consider that environmental sustainability is already adequately covered in the section and is confusing. So, we would prefer opposition amendment (6) on sheet 7477. We believe that the issues the Greens have raised are adequately covered in opposition amendment (6).\n\nJanet Rice\n\nI am interested to know how Senator Johnston thinks this would be adding to red tape. I cannot see how having overarching criteria of environmental sustainability and integration could possibly be adding to red tape.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nWe all know that the words 'environmental sustainability' have a common-usage definition but also a legal definition. When you introduce phrases like that into the day-to-day administration of what should be a simple funding regime, as this bill seeks to do, you really do open a bit of a Pandora's box in terms of administration on the ground and in terms of budgetary positions and compliance issues. These phrases now, rightly or wrongly\u2014and I do not criticise the importance of them\u2014do carry with them some responsibility to get things right. All I am saying is that in this instance this is inappropriate. It makes it more complex to administer. And I do not think that is what we are about.\n\nJanet Rice\n\nAgain, I would have thought that the responsibility to get things right in terms of where you are putting your transport investment dollars is something that any legislation should be doing. So, I wonder what problems the government has with that responsibility to get things right and making sure that the investment in transport is being spent in the most effective way in terms of economic efficiency, environmental sustainability and social issues.\n\nDavid Johnston\n\nI am advised that in section 11 of the bill says:\n\nThe matters to which the Minister may have regard in deciding whether it is appropriate to approve a project as an Investment Project include, but are not limited to, the following matters:\n\n\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u2026\n\n(c) the results of any assessment of the economic, environmental or social costs or benefits of the project;\n\nThe point about that is that by injecting this in where you want to do so, I think you are substantially adding a cost burden to the assessment of these programs.\n\nThe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: The question is that amendment (7) be agreed to.\n\nQuestion negatived.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
