    "summary": "Scott Ludlam\n\nI move Australian Greens amendment (2) on sheet 7710:\n\n(2) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 13 and 14), omit paragraph 115A(1)(b), substitute:\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(b) the online location flagrantly infringes the copyright; and\n\nPeter Whish-Wilson\n\nThe committee is considering the Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015. The question is that amendment (2) on sheet 7710, moved by Senator Ludlam, be agreed to.\n\nJacinta Collins\n\nWhen we concluded just before question time, Senator Fierravanti-Wells had just concluded the government's position. I will now move to our position on Greens amendment (2). I might suggest to Senator Ludlam that he move amendments (2), (3), (7) and (8) together, as they all deal with the issues he raised, as indeed does amendment (2), which removes facilitation of copyright infringement as a criterion for issuing an injunction, and the issue of imposing flagrancy as a criterion.\n\nWith respect to the first point, Labor understands the concerns raised by some in this debate about the breadth of the term 'facilitate' in this bill. However, it is important to note the context in which the word appears. The bill only covers websites which have the primary purpose of infringing copyright or facilitating copyright infringement. Clearly, all manner of websites might unwittingly and unintentionally facilitate the infringement of copyright in one way or another, but that is not the test. The question is whether it is the primary purpose of a website to do so. As a result, Labor is satisfied that it is appropriate for facilitation to remain in the bill, and we will not support this amendment.\n\nWith regard to the second point, with respect to flagrancy, as I have said, the 'primary purpose' test in this bill imposes a deliberately high burden on rights holders making their case to the Federal Court. This amendment would add to the test a requirement that a site flagrantly infringed copyright. Flagrancy is a concept known to Australian copyright law, and it has been used in legislation similar to this bill in other jurisdictions. However, as I have said, and as the committee concluded, the primary purpose is the appropriate threshold requirement for the grant of an injunction. I note that, under the bill as presently drafted, flagrancy is already a matter the court can take account of in deciding whether to grant an injunction. Similarly, the court can also take into account whether the site shows a disregard for copyright generally. Labor believes that the current drafting is appropriate, and will not support amendments with respect to imposing flagrancy as a criterion.\n\nThe TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN: Senator Ludlam, do you want to move only amendment (2), or a broader range of amendments?\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nNo, and I will speak to my reasons for not doing that. I understand the point that you raise, Senator Collins, and I will take it as read that that is the position of the opposition for that series of amendments. The reason I am moving them separately is that this amendment deals specifically with flagrancy, and in a moment I will get to my strong concerns with how wide the term 'facilitate' is. But I will move through these amendments one at a time.\n\nNoting the comments from both the government side and the opposition side, I am not going to detain us for too long before putting the amendment. It might sound a little bit technical, and I do not believe by any means that the concerns that I am putting on the record have been met by the comments of either the opposition leader here this afternoon or by the government. I will quote briefly from the Australian Digital Alliance submission to the bill, because it goes to the direction and the target of this amendment. The way that they put it is in their submission to the Senate inquiry is thus:\n\n\u2026 the most preferable outcome would be to consider flagrancy as part of the scope for the online locations that can be blocked under the injunctive process (ie, a precondition for eligibility for site blocking injunction, not merely one of the factors to be assessed in determining whether to make an order). The flagrancy of the infringement is frequently referred to in the explanatory memorandum. It is a strong safeguards to ensure that injunctions are used against the most blatantly infringing sites et cetera without catching infringing services.\n\nThat is why we have targeted the amendment in the way that we have to effectively raise the threshold, or raise the bar, to make sure that in order for a court to issue one of these injunctions on application by a rights holder the sites must be flagrantly infringing copyright. I do not think that is unreasonable. I think it is a great shame that, evidently, this deal has been done outside this chamber and nobody from the major parties is inclined to consider this amendment. Nonetheless, I commend it to the chamber.\n\nSean Edwards\n\nThe question is that amendment (2) on sheet 7710, moved by Senator Ludlam, be agreed to.\n\nQuestion negatived.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nby leave\u2014I move Australian Greens amendments (3), (7) and (8) on sheet 7710:\n\n(3) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 15 and 16), omit \" , or to facilitate the infringement of, \" .\n\n(7) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 10 and 11), omit \" , or the flagrancy of the facilitation of the infringement, \" .\n\n(8) Schedule 1, item 1, page 4 (lines 14 and 15), omit \" , or facilitate an infringement of, \" .\n\nWhat these three amendments do collectively is remove the way that the bill is drafted at the moment, which allows rights holders to seek court injunctions to target sites that facilitate copyright infringement, as opposed to 'enable' copyright infringement. There has been a lot of commentary through the Senate inquiry and outside the Senate inquiry process that has been very concerned about the breadth of the term 'facilitate' as it applies to copyright infringement. It is unnecessarily broad, and it is unclear. It could be used to, for example, take down cloud computing storage sites or services that link shortening sites or social media sites. It could be used to take down sites that provide technical tools that have entirely legitimate uses\u2014for example, sites that provide large file transfer software such as WeTransfer and others. These services absolutely could be argued to facilitate copyright infringement. There is nothing stopping you from, for example, using a file transfer platform like WeTransfer to transfer a copyright infringing item from one party to another. That is absolutely not why that tool was built and it is not why the vast majority of users would use a service like that. Nonetheless, it can be swept up.\n\nThe government will probably argue that the bill is drafted tightly enough as it is. I would take strong issue with that. If this is to be targeted we should not be including language as broad as 'facilitating'. I will again quote from page 7 of the Australian Digital Alliance submission:\n\nThe Macquarie dictionary defines 'facilitation' as:\n\n1. to make easier or less difficult; help forward (an action, a process, etc.).\n\n2. to assist the progress of (a person): to facilitate the customer to find the right product.\n\nThis is immensely broad language. It is exceptionally broad language for a bill that covers the consequences of knocking websites and platforms offline. They continue:\n\nThis could conceivably cover a number of online locations offering products that have legitimate uses, but which may also be used assist in copyright infringement. VPNs\u2014\n\nand I will be dealing with VPNs in a separate amendment shortly\u2014\n\ncloud storage providers, providers of Bit Torrent or Internet Relay Chat ('IRC') software, browser plug ins or conversion tools may all be covered, as may blogs or subreddits discussing techniques or sites that may be used to infringe. A project such as Open Rights Group's attempt to transparently list the sites that have been blocked under the UK legislation may have a primary purpose of facilitating copyright infringement if the majority of users used the list to find sites with infringing content.\n\nAnd that is irrespective of the motives of those who put that list up there. Again, if we are going to have site blocking legislation such as this on the statute books\u2014effectively an internet filter managed through the courts by foreign rights holders\u2014shouldn't we ensure that it is targeted absolutely as narrowly as possible, not at things that facilitate copyright infringement but at things that infringe copyright? That is the distinction we are seeking to draw here. Senator Collins did indicate the position on the half of the opposition a short time ago. I would love to hear from the government why you would be knocking over a perfectly sensible amendment such as this.\n\nConcetta Fierravanti-Wells\n\nOn the question of facilitation, I would just like to note that the bill contains a facilitation element because many of the online locations that are intended to be the subject of an injunction operate in such a manner as to avoid directly infringing copyright. For example, they do not host infringing content, but provide links or other means for users to obtain the infringing material. These websites are facilitators, and the bill is designed to ensure that they cannot avoid an injunction by simply not hosting or directly infringing copyright. Facilitation is intended to be a broad and flexible concept, as distinct from existing legal doctrine such as authorisation liability. In particular, in relation to amendment (7) it is unnecessary to include flagrancy as part of the threshold test in subsection (1). The existing primary purpose test is already an intentionally high threshold test that will not include legitimate websites. We have included a number of examples in the revised explanatory memorandum to make this adequately clear. For example, the primary purpose test would prevent an injunction to disable access to an art gallery website operated outside of Australia that may contain an unauthorised photograph.\n\nDavid Leyonhjelm\n\nMinister, what you have just described\u2014a website that could be interpreted as facilitating infringing material via links\u2014could very well apply to a search engine such as Google. How do you intend to avoid that problem?\n\nConcetta Fierravanti-Wells\n\nI am instructed that the existing primary purpose test would cover that situation.\n\nSean Edwards\n\nThe question is that amendments (3), (7) and (8) on sheet 7710, moved by Senator Ludlam, be agreed to.\n\nQuestion negatived.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI move Australian Greens amendment (4) on sheet 7710:\n\n(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (after line 17), after subsection 115A(1), insert:\n\n(1A) To avoid doubt, for the purposes of subsection (1) a virtual private network is not an online location.\n\nI will see if I can improve my luck on this one! This amendment goes to very serious concerns that I have that this bill could be used, and could be interpreted by courts, to prevent the use of VPNs\u2014virtual private networks. It was an issue that was canvassed briefly in some of the contributions to the debate on the second reading. This amendment proposes to clean up this dangerous ambiguity, so that it is at least one thing that we do not have to worry about.\n\nA VPN is a legitimate technical tool with many uses which have nothing to do with copyright infringement. It is used as a security measure and as a way for people to collaborate on a private network across multiple sites. I think Senator Leyonhjelm, in his earlier contribution, identified that when we log on to the Parliament House network from home base or from on the road, using our security token, we are in effect using a virtual private network. They have multiple legitimate uses across industry, government, security agencies\u2014take your pick. You could argue that they also have more niche uses, which are nonetheless valuable and entirely legitimate. For example, a whistleblower could use a VPN to hide their internet address and protect their identity while revealing important information to a journalist. That would be one argument. A VPN may be used by a journalist to prevent their sources from being exposed. It may be used by a systems administrator to test if their company's network is functioning correctly.\n\nBoth the communications minister and the shadow Attorney-General have stated that the bill is not intended to capture or block or prevent the use of VPNs. But this is not good enough. Ambiguities have already been introduced\u2014maybe wittingly, maybe unwittingly\u2014by Senator Fierravanti-Wells's contribution before the debate was interrupted for question time. When interpreting whether these things are in or out, the courts must be given certainty as to parliament's intention. The smartest way for us to do that is to make sure that it is in the law. If any loophole is left in the legislation, then it may well be that these clauses are tested by rights-holders trying their luck, and the unintended\u2014or intended\u2014consequences of that would be quite profound.\n\nThis is a very simple amendment. It is designed to explicitly remove VPNs from the scope of the bill. I commend it to the chamber.\n\nJacinta Collins\n\nLabor shares the Greens party's concern that this bill should not capture VPNs. This bill, as I explained in my remarks earlier this morning, is directed only at the worst of the worst\u2014websites which intentionally and brazenly flout copyright law. It is difficult to see how VPN services, which have a wide range of legitimate purposes, could satisfy the primary purpose test in this bill. Nevertheless, for the avoidance of doubt, Labor has asked the government to respond to the concerns expressed by the committee about this issue by inserting into the explanatory memorandum a clarification that the bill will not target VPN services. As a result, this amendment is superfluous.\n\nI note, too, the undesirability of including in primary legislation a reference to a particular technology. We should strive to produce technology-neutral drafting. Thus, Labor will not support this amendment.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
