    "summary": "Scott Ludlam\n\nI have a very quick question for the government and Senator Fierravanti-Wells, who looks as though she might have been thrown in the deep end. Is Senator Fierravanti-Wells aware of whether the Attorney-General will be gracing us with his presence this morning?\n\nConcetta Fierravanti-Wells\n\nYes, the Attorney-General is on his way. _(Quorum formed)_\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI thank the Attorney for joining us. Probably Senator Xenophon will reserve his right to ask general overview questions. I ran through most of mine last night so I am proposing to start working through the amendments. I also offer a note of thanks to the clerks, who probably worked all night to give us the running sheet for a very complicated set of amendments from a few different sources. I now seek leave to move Australian Greens amendments (1) and (4) on sheet 7669 together.\n\nLeave granted.\n\nI move:\n\n(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (line 14), omit \"specified in or under section 187AA\", substitute \"specified in section 187AA\".\n\n(4) Schedule 1, item 1, page 8 (line 1) to page 9 (line 2), omit subsections 187AA(2) to (5), substitute:\n\n(2) For the purposes of items 2, 3, 4 and 6 of the table in subsection (1), 2 or more communications that together constitute a single communications session are taken to be a single communication.\n\nThese amendments are identical to those of Senator Leyonhjelm, so presumably he will add some commentary as well. This debate has been somewhat bogged down from the very beginning in definitions of the kind of data that the government wants telecommunications carriers to collect. Everybody would be well aware that the Attorney did not help his cause at all by not being clear, but that is not a confusion that is isolated to the Attorney-General alone. The discussion has been bogged down in definitions of metadata, which is a phrase that is not even really a term of art in the telecommunications sector. It can mean pretty much what people want it to mean.\n\nIt is extraordinary, firstly, that the government initially proposed to bring together a bill to impose on telecommunications carriers an obligation to store material that some of them were not storing. There are matters on the record from Telstra and from the Communications Alliance that this is not just about extending a reporting obligation for material that is already being stored. No matter what the government thinks, and the communications minister has been just as guilty of making this contention, it is simply not the case. The Attorney-General's Department has been proposing an arbitrary two-year mandatory data retention capture and storage plan since at least 2008 that I am aware of, but as recently as January the government still did not know what kinds of material it wanted to force industry to keep. That is remarkable in itself.\n\nThe second interesting thing is that the government wanted to keep that definition of the material it wanted industry to store outside the act, in regulations, which makes it much easier for the definition to arbitrarily change. That has flow-on consequences for service providers who have to adjust their systems, not only in capturing the material but in organising for it to be retrieved, presumably reasonably promptly for agencies that will occasionally be in a serious hurry, and brought to light in a form that could potentially be used as evidence in court proceedings. What the government wanted to do, and the bill before us is not completely dissimilar to the government's original intention, was have the definition in regulations so they could change it very rapidly, without consultation with the technology sector or the general public and without recourse to this parliament.\n\nThe government has taken a measure of credit, and I guess we should observe it where it is due, that the definition of metadata is now in the bill\u2014I will have a little more to say about that later\u2014but the government still reserves the right to arbitrarily change the definition of material it wants to capture and store and then give itself 40 sitting days for parliament to ratify the decision. Last count, looking at the parliamentary calendar, there were only 58 Senate sitting days this year\u2014the House sits a little bit more than we do because we have four weeks of budget estimates\u2014which means that the time between the government, potentially on a whim, deciding that it needs new material and needs to expand the scope of the bill in the regulations and parliament catching up and ratifying the decision could be seven or eight or nine months.\n\nWe will move an amendment down the track that takes that extraordinary 40-day sitting day window and restricts it to four, but that amendment will only be necessary if this amendment of the Australian Greens does not prevail. What this amendment seeks to do is remove the ability of the Attorney-General to arbitrarily widen the scope of metadata that it insists telecommunications carriers trap and store.\n\nBefore I commit the amendment to the chamber, I am very interested to know what criteria the Attorney-General proposes to apply\u2014because my understanding is that this will reside with your office, Attorney\u2014for adding information types to the scope of the bill. So what would we expect to be happening behind the scenes prior to an announcement by the government that it is has actually widened the scope of the data retention scheme? What process will you follow and what criteria will you have regard to before making such a decision?\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nSenator Ludlam, as you have acknowledged, the definition of the description of the categories of metadata has been located in the bill. The government has done that, having considered the recommendations of the PJCIS, and it now forms proposed section 187AA.\n\nProposed section 187AA sets out in descriptive terms six different categories. In the event, because of changes in technology, technologies develop or emerge in which information of the kind referred to in those six broad categories are retained and those technologies answer the description of metadata, then the bill preserves the flexibility in using the mechanism to which you have adverted of expanding the definition. The purpose here is not to expand the scope of that which is the subject of the retention obligation but rather to give the government the flexibility to keep pace with evolving technology so that, if there is an evolution so that a currently unanticipated form of metadata were to emerge following the development, for example, or a new device or a new form of communication, then that could be added to the list subject to the approval of the parliament after the requisite 40-day sitting day period. It is not the intention to alter the nature of the categories merely to enable us to have the flexibility to contemporise the description of the way in which metadata falling within those categories is retained.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI thank the Attorney for his answer. I still do not feel any closer to an understanding\u2014although I think I understand where the government is coming from, and there is no contention about the fact that the technology changes and new categories of data would be brought into existence over the life of the bill such as this. But I am still no wiser as to what process would be followed\u2014for example, are there consultation periods that I have missed within industry, given how long and contentious it has been settling the definition to date? What comfort can we give industry today? Will it be given set periods of time or completely arbitrary period of time to comply with new categories of material that the government decides it requires to be kept?\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nSenator Ludlam, as you know, there has been very extensive consultation with industry in the development of this dataset, and the government anticipates that that consultation with industry will continue. This is a collaborative process, so you ask what sort of process the government will undertake\u2014to which the best answer I can give you is: a collaborative process in consultation with industry.\n\nThis is classically an example of the government of necessity collaborating with industry in a partnership to achieve a common end. What we envisage is continuing collaboration with industry. The scheme established by this bill, which imposes, as you know, the primary obligation upon industry of necessity, envisages that the government will continue to consult with and collaborate with industry in any decision about amending the descriptions of the dataset and would undoubtedly be arrived at in consultation with industry.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nBut I am correct in my understanding that there is nothing in the bill that prescribed particular periods of time or anything to give guidance to you or your successor in adding certain kinds of data to the scope.\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nNo, that is correct. The way this bill will operate when it is enacted is dynamically so that there will always be of necessity, as I said in answer to your previous question, collaboration with industry. In my view it would fetter the flexibility of that collaboration were there to be prescriptive machinery provisions of the kind that you seem to be suggesting incorporated within the bill.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nI thank the minister for that. Why is the government insisting that service providers retain data volume? What possible national security consequence could that have?\n\nJust so the minister is completely aware of where I am going, there has been plenty of conjecture as to the ways in which this bill, when it is enacted into law, will be used through processes of civil discovery or, potentially, criminal prosecution should the law relating to copyright infringement ever change. That volume usage would be very useful if rights holders, for example, were attempting to track down illegal file sharing. What is the government's rationale for including volume uses on page 8 of the bill in the table, 'Kinds of information to be kept'?\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nThose provisions were developed in consultation with the security agencies and on the basis of the information that they gave to the PJCIS. Since you raise the matter, Senator, can I reassure you\u2014and I do not know how many times I have to say this\u2014that it is not the purpose of this bill to enable, through a process of third-party discovery, access by civil parties in civil litigation of the kind that you refer to, or at all. This is about facilitating criminal investigations.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nSenator Brandis, I am delighted to take you at your word; there are many who will not. One of the things that we are here to do today is track down the possible unintended consequences of a bill such as this. I would like to get some details particularly about location. There is a lot of concern around the fact that included well and truly within the scope of the bill is location of a particular device when a call connects and when it disconnects or when a communication is initiated and when it is concluded. For example, for a mobile phone handset within a metropolitan area where you are surrounded by probably half a dozen cell towers at any given time, to what degree of accuracy does that allow a particular device to be located?\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nSenator Ludlam, the bill does not prescribe that. What the bill prescribes is the obligation, and the obligation is described in terms of the data set required to be retained. As to the operation of the scheme from a technical point of view, that really is beyond the scope of the bill. It is not something on which I am going to respond to you. What this bill sets up is a scheme that works upon the application to a primary obligation defined in terms of the data set of the obligations of telecommunications companies. A technical question of that kind is well beyond the scope of the bill.\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nThe technicalities may be beyond the scope of what you are able to provide us with, but they are certainly not beyond the scope of the bill. Under item 6, topic column 1, 'The location of equipment, or a line, used in connection with a communication', in the way that the bill is currently drafted:\n\nThe following in relation to the equipment or line used to send or receive the communication:\n\n(a) the location of the equipment or line at the start of the communication;\n\n(b) the location of the equipment or line at the end of the communication. Then you have put, helpfully, two examples:\n\nCell towers, Wi-Fi hotspots. I can see that some of your advisers have arrived, which is good. I do not think that it is anything like outside the scope of the bill to tell us to what degree of accuracy does that allow particular devices to be pinpointed. That is well within the scope of the bill.\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nSenator Ludlam, you are referring, I think, to item 6 of the table in proposed section 187AA, is that right?\n\nScott Ludlam\n\nThat is right.\n\nGeorge Brandis\n\nThe obligation is as set out in item 6. The obligation is not expressed in terms of quantitative measurement. It creates an obligation to retain certain data by reference to, in this case, that which is described in item 6. That is a qualitatively, not quantitatively, expressed obligation.\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
