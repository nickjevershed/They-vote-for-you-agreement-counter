    "summary": "Doug Cameron\n\nI move opposition amendment (6) on sheet 7771 revised:\n\n(6) Schedule 1, page 16 (after line 15), after item 48, insert:\n\n48A After subsection 240(3)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Insert:\n\n_FWC may deal with greenfields agreement dispute_\n\n\u00a0\u00a0(3A) The FWC may deal with a dispute about a proposed single-enterprise agreement that is a greenfields agreement on its own initiative if the FWC is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so.\n\n48B Before subsection 240(4)\n\n\u00a0\u00a0Insert:\n\n_Bargaining representatives may agree that FWC can arbitrate_\n\nThis is about expanding conciliation in relation to greenfields agreements. We heard much from the minister yesterday about bringing certain aspects of the Fair Work Act into the greenfields agreement making and why that was a good thing. If that is the principle then the principle of bringing the aspects of section 240 of the Fair Work Act, which provides a bargaining representative may apply to the Fair Work Commission to deal with a dispute by way of conciliation, should also be in this bill. It would allow the Fair Work Commission to deal with a dispute by way of conciliation on its own initiative, if the Fair Work Commission is satisfied that it is in the public interest to do so. It keeps that greenfields agreement negotiations consistent with the broader act. It was an argument that the opposition put forcefully yesterday. So, on that basis, I would think the government should accept this as part of the principle. Yesterday, they argued about bringing these issues into line.\n\nMinister, I want to go to some of the issues that you raised yesterday in your responses. You indicated that good faith bargaining provisions had been extended to greenfields agreements and you argued that that would improve accountability in the negotiation process. You then spoke about past practice. You said:\n\n\u2026 one would anticipate based on past practice that the majority of agreements are going to be negotiated \u2026\n\nThat is page 94 of _Hansard_. You say that in the majority of cases the employer and the relevant unions will be able to reach an agreement. Minister, isn't it the case that presently all greenfields agreements are negotiated, not merely a majority?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nSenator Cameron, it is implicit in the greenfields process that all agreements are negotiated. Yes, that is the process.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nSo, when you spoke about the majority yesterday, that was just how it was presented. But you have clarified there that all the agreements are negotiated, not merely a majority. Presently, do you agree that all greenfields agreements are negotiated, not just a majority? None are excluded?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nNo, Senator Cameron. I think you misunderstood what I said last night. As we went through it last night, you have greenfields agreements, you have an employer and you have a union or unions. Under the greenfields process, they get together and negotiate an agreeme\n\nMany agreements are actually agreed by the employer and the union or unions. In some cases, there will not be an agreement. We are implementing the relief valve\u2014that is, going to the Fair Work Commission as the individual umpire. So I think there was just a slight misunderstanding in terms of what I said last night.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nMinister, it is the statement you made last night that I am seeking clarification on\u2014not what you have just said. You said last night that one would anticipate that, based on past practice, the majority of agreements are going to be negotiated. You used the word 'majority'. You then said later:\n\n\u2026 in the majority of cases the employer and the relevant union or unions will be able to reach an agreement.\n\nDo you accept that, based on past practice, all greenfield agreements\u2014not the majority but all of them\u2014have been negotiated? It is a simple, factual position.\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nAgain, I think it is just the way that you have interpreted what I said last night. It is implicit within the greenfields process that there is negotiation. Whether or not there is an agreement is up to the parties. If there is an agreement, that is good. If there is not an agreement, then they can utilise the relief valve and go to the Fair Work Commission.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nMinister, thanks for the answer. Last night, again, you said that the employer then has the optional process of commencing the six-month period by notifying the union. Do you anticipate that any negotiations would take place before a notified negotiating period commences? There is no requirement to negotiate before a notified negotiation period commences, is there?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nI personally am not able to anticipate what various parties will do. But, as you will be aware, what we are doing with this particular amendment, as we discussed at length last night, is bringing into the greenfields provisions what is currently not there\u2014that is, the good faith bargaining provisions. So you would expect parties to bargain in good faith, and where they cannot reach an agreement the employer is able to utilise this process should the employer wish to.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\n_Hansard_ recorded you last night as saying:\n\n\u2026 I think we would all hope that during that six-month period an agreement can be reached between the employer and the union or the unions.\n\nThat is on page 96 of the _Hansard_. Minister, there is clearly an incentive for the union to reach agreement with the employer. If they do not, then the employer can lodge an agreement that contains whatever they would like\u2014that is, whatever the employer would like. What is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\n) ( ): Again, you and I canvassed this for several hours last night. The evidence I gave last night will be the evidence that I re-give you now. I disagree with the fact that the employer can present any agreement that they like. I made it very clear last night that the union must be given a reasonable opportunity to sign the agreement that is put to the Fair Work Commission for approval. If the union has not seen the agreement, then the Fair Work Commission will not be able to approve that particular agreement.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nMinister, you simply have not answered the question. The question I have put is: there are obvious incentives for the unions to reach agreement but there is no incentive that you have indicated for employers to reach agreement with the union within the six months; so what is the incentive, under the process that you are proposing, for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nGiven that the employer has a project which the employer wants to start, given that the employer is going to have a body of employees waiting to become people who are actually employed, given that the employer is the one assuming all of the risk in relation to this project and given that the employer is probably going to have international financiers who are saying, 'Unless you can get this agreement in place, we may not be able to provide the finance,' I am assuming, Senator Cameron, that there is going to be great incentive for the employer to come to an agreement with the union or unions.\n\nIn any event, as I have consistently stated and I will state again, one of the good things that we are doing in relation to this part of the act\u2014which the former government failed to do\u2014is that we are bringing in the good faith bargaining provisions so that employers and employees have to negotiate in good faith. But the other addition to this part of the act\u2014which, again, Labor failed to do in their legislation\u2014is that we are now bringing in, as part of the approval criteria at item 33, prevailing pay and conditions as one of the criteria for the approval of the agreement. Currently, as you would be aware, it is the better off overall test, and you are compared to the relevant award. We are saying, 'If you are going to submit an agreement to the commission for approval, that test is now prevailing pay and conditions as an approval criterion,' and everyone knows, Senator Cameron, that they are going to be higher.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nAgain, I just say, Minister, that the incentive for the employees and the unions\u2014that is, the union representing the employees\u2014is clear. The incentive for the employer, as you outlined, probably gives a bit of strength to the argument that we have been putting, and that is that the incentive for the employer would be to hang on and not make any concessions until the employer gets the agreement that it wants to put to the commission after the six-month period. If you have, as you have indicated, prevailing pay and conditions as the benchmark, that means that workers would not be in a position through that bargaining process to improve on the prevailing pay and conditions. Is that not so?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nThat is not correct. They will have an opportunity, but again I go to the point that the award applies currently under your system; under our system it is prevailing pay and conditions. There is a fundamental difference. I also refer you to the review panel that the now Leader of the Opposition Bill Shorten himself handpicked to review your legislation. One of the reasons that we are standing here today is that there are a number of recommendations made by that review panel\u2014your review panel, your handpicked people. We canvassed this last night: the reason that the government is considering this greenfields relief valve measure is that an issue has been clearly identified that certain unions have in some circumstances frustrated greenfields agreement processes. Again, we canvassed this last night, and at that time I read from the findings of Labor's own handpicked reviewers of the Fair Work Act, where they recalled evidence and submissions that some unions had hijacked the greenfields processes, that greenfields negotiations were lengthy, torturous and onerous and that within itself jeopardises projects.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nMinister, I do not know why you will not go to the point and answer the question. It is okay to give us all the rhetorical flourishes that you have in your speaking notes, but the reality is that I am asking a simple question, and that is: what is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period, when clearly, on what you outlined early in your answer, it is probably a better incentive for them, if it is all about cost pressures, to resist any improvements to pay and conditions. Thanks very much for advising me that there is a difference between an award and prevailing pay and conditions. I think most people do understand that, but that does not go to the question\u2014what is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period? Doesn't it mean that, if the determination is made on prevailing pay and conditions, then the unions cannot negotiate improvements in pay and conditions in the areas that are under disagreement for prospective employees\u2014so prevailing pay and conditions become a cap?\n\nJanet Rice\n\nSimilarly the question to the minister is: where is the incentive for the employer to do anything other? If they cannot reach agreement with the union, they will just sit there and wait out the six months. Those six months may not be much time at all in the whole timeframe of development of the industry. They will sit there and wait and, if no negotiation is needed after that, you can see that is how it will play out.\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nUnfortunately, Senator Rice, that comment shows a complete lack of understanding of how business works. In any event, the mere fact is that we are bringing in the good-faith bargaining provisions. I can only say that so many times. If you go to that section of the act, and it is quite a lengthy section of the act, you can read what good-faith bargaining is\u2014maybe you have not had an opportunity to read that\u2014and that will outline for you step by step exactly what the employer and the relevant union or unions are required to do by way of good-faith bargaining. In the event that they do not bargain in good faith, one of the parties can go to the Fair Work Commission and they are able to seek what is known as a bargaining order from the commission.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nThis is a very important issue, and I am going to persevere with the question. Given that there is clearly an incentive for the unions to reach agreement with the employer\u2014if they do not reach agreement and the employer can lodge an agreement that contains the issues that employer wants imposed on workers. What is the incentive for the employer to reach agreement with the union within the six-month period? Do you not agree that by maintaining the prevailing pay and conditions there is no capacity under your bargaining approach for unions to increase and improve wages and conditions for employees who could be covered by that greenfield agreement?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nNo, I do not.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nMinister, could you explain: if it is the prevailing pay and conditions that then apply, how could that be an improvement on pay and conditions for workers in that project, when compared to other projects?\n\nMichaelia Cash\n\nSenator Cameron, again I do worry that you do not understand what prevailing pay and conditions are, as compared to an award. You keep talking about a cap. In fact, it is the other way around\u2014it is not a cap; it is actually a floor.\n\nDoug Cameron\n\nSo, Minister, if it is a floor, my understanding of a floor is something that you build on\u2014something you stand on to build on. If this is the floor, how then, under your legislation, can a union improve on the prevailing pay and conditions for prospective employees?\n\nLong debate text truncated.\n\n",
